,,,
1,,Peter,this is the new-
2,,Adrian,this is the new-
3,,Peter,ah the completely new one
4,,Adrian,[points to drawing] we’re in there looking out at that bit there you 
5,,,parked just here so what we’re trying to do is to extend the car park 
6,,,here to make an entirely new car park and the idea is that basically you 
7,,,enter here and by signposting you’re directed as a cortege if you like 
8,,,this way the cortege would park there whereas the present cortege 
9,,,would park here and you go into this chapel and have your service 
10,,,where this chapel gets a garden round the back this chapel gets a 
11,,,garden round here
12,,Angela,we’ve put these (images) up
13,,Adrian,I’m impressed
14,,Angela,are you oh well I got those from the website for the-
15,,Adrian,kimble
16,,Angela,from the kimble museum so that people could see what we were 
17,,,trying to do so I copied them to show them what they idea was and 
18,,,where it came from I put them up so that people could see and 
19,0:06:00,,everyone could sort of comment and have some sort of feedback from 
20,,,that just to start with even just at this stage really
21,,Adrian,good well I’ll look forward to hearing the feedback because that’s the 
22,,,purpose of the meeting after all yeah that’s great
23,,Peter,I’m Peter Lloyd by the way
24,,Angela,hello Peter pleased to meet you where are you sitting Chris
25,,Adrian,this is Angela Abbot registrar of the cemetery excuse me for not 
26,,,introducing you we’re still waiting for one we’re waiting for Ben Hill 
27,,Angela,I’ve just recent- I’ve just purchased a new book called british 
28,,,crematoriums: history architecture and landscape
29,,Adrian,oh right
30,,Angela,I tried to go through the sap system it was a complete nightmare so I 
31,,,brought it myself because it’s just a waste of time doing it through sap 
32,,,so I shall get that and I’ll have a read of that as well it’s a recent book
33,,Adrian,[reads] Hilary Granger you told me about Hilary Granger before
34,,Angela,yes she’s been to have a look at our existing we’re mentioned in the 
35,,,book quite a bit with the existing chapel she was quite impressed 
36,0:07:00,,because we’ve also got quite a lot of photographs and other things and 
37,,,plans like the forward plan of extending the chapel originally the original
38,,,idea so that was quite forward thinking in nineteen eighty or seventy 
39,,,whenever seventy eight when they decided on that + so I’ve sent off for 
40,,,that but you try and get them to raise a sap order for it and you get how 
41,,,often will we need the spire books company I said well we’ll never use 
42,,,them again probably why do you need to do that oh for god’s sake
43,,,so I just went out and bought it and the one above as well a history 
44,,,of cremations that’s what we have at home on the bookshelf [all laugh] 
45,,,cheerful reading like you when you go on holiday with your part- your 
46,,,husband and wife + you see a sign for crematorium straight away 
47,,,ignoring them [all laugh] whether you’re abroad or in this country the 
48,,,first thing you do straight away oh not another cemetery they go oh dear 
49,0:08:00,,how dare you + yeah so committed to the cleansing flames is the 
50,,,other one I brought yeah ++ very interesting sorry actually that looks like 
51,,,the one they went to have a look at in nottingham I think when they 
52,,,designed this one they went to quite a few places
53,,Chris,is that the eh ++ drive through one
54,,Angela,no the new ones yeah well that- no I said to you they all look like tescos 
55,,,but Andy said to me you know what they look like are mcdonalds drive 
56,,,through and they do they do look like that they look awful look that’s the 
57,,,new one up in nottingham no inventiveness
58,,Adrian,a lot of people feel at home going to mcdonalds
59,,Angela,yes it’s wrong for me to criticize because they’ve obviously had it 
60,,,designed and it obviously works for them it obviously works for this 
61,,,company and they’ve obviously got somebody that has done the plan 
62,,,and they’ve just reused the design but I cannot understand like she said 
63,,,really there you know should be some well anyway you know it looks 
64,,,like a mcdonalds drive through and they all look near enough the same 
65,,,which is awful shame there’s a about six or seven of them and they’ve all 
66,,,got this sort of mcdonalds drive through tescos don’t know where you 
67,0:09:00,,are sort of look
68,,Adrian,well hopefully we’re offering you something a bit different
69,,Angela,well that’s what my brief is when I’m telling people I’m saying to 
70,,,people
71,,Adrian,and now for something completely different
72,,Angela,yes why not why not take the opportunity to do that
73,,Adrian,exactly but as I was just saying to Peter earlier you know it’s a dream 
74,,,come true for an architect to do such a project so I’m very excited by it 
75,,,erm the purpose of the meeting as I see it is to obtain your feedback to the 
76,,,design having received erm Chris’s order for to work to proceed up to 
77,,,planning when was it a few weeks ago now and + we thought it would be 
78,,,a very good idea to have another meeting to update everybody as to 
79,,,where we’ve got to and to receive your feedback because the last time 
80,,,you and I met Angela you said you were interested in talking to funeral 
81,,,directors and so on and so forth obtain feedback from people who’d be 
82,,,using the building
83,,Angela,which is everyone that’s come in has been dragged in to show even 
84,0:10:00,,my mum’s had a look [laughs]
85,,Adrian,well the design has developed a wee bit since erm you saw it last time 
86,,,erm the design obviously is still in exactly the same place but the design 
87,,,is extended to include the actual cremator facility so if I can start 
88,,,with this particular drawing err you’ve seen a version of this drawing 
89,,,before basically we’re arriving in the new car park in this area and 
90,,,from the car park we’ll enter the building through a waiting area this this 
91,,,leads us to the first query I have because um there was some discussion 
92,,,about whether you wanted the size of the waiting room increased at 
93,,,the moment it’s exactly on brief but it does look + kind of small to my 
94,,,eye in relation to the size of the project
95,,Angela,yes I’d be interested to know in a sense what sort of seat- er how many 
96,,,seats in a sense you could get in a sense that most people arrive 
97,0:11:00,,probably at least
98,,Secretary,[knocks on the door] is Ben here (  )
99,,Adrian,we’re expecting Ben
100,,Angela,yes but the heating people I’ve said I won’t be able to see them until 
101,,,possibly later this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon is it mr bonnington 
102,,Secretary,yes it is
103,,Angela,he was wanting to go down to animal control to start looking
104,,,at the work in there but I did tell him I had a meeting all 
105,,,morning and tomorrow morning as well
106,,Secretary,and tomorrow morning
107,,Chris,yes I mean if you take him over to animal control
108,,Angela,that’s what is got he came here to do 
109,,Secretary,he knows what he’s got to do-
110,,Chris,Yes (  )
111,,Secretary,OK [leaves room]
112,,Adrian,to answer your question it’s a relatively small room the area is similar 
113,,,to the existing waiting room and as such you are unlikely to get more than
114,0:12:00,,about eight to ten maximum twelve seats in there I would have thought 
115,,,probably because the building well the room is doing so much its 
116,,,allowing people through into the porch area it’s also allowing access to
117,,,the loos so my first question to you is is waiting the room big enough and 
118,,,would you like us to increase it
119,,Angela,I would say although the time spent sitting and waiting might not be 
120,,,very long and eight seats seems enough at some stages even our waiting 
121,,,room is too big so its slightly I’m also thinking of the fact that if we’ve 
122,,,got a flow of people walking through that then restricts us we can’t put 
123,,,seats through that because in a sense we need to keep an access open 
124,,,and so the seating will be against the wall
125,,Adrian,what I’d recommend is that we look at doing something like that 
126,,,extending it which will give you seating areas here seating areas here 
127,,,seating areas here as well as here and here which effectively will double 
128,,,the seating capacity from what I was just saying
129,,Angela,yes I mean people waiting for cabs or for people waiting to be picked 
130,0:13:00,,up as well for services you know it might not sort of eight might be more 
131,,,than enough for funerals for the majority of the time but I would think 
132,,,it’s nice to give them a bit more space as well because we might get 
133,,,people waiting for the eleven o’clock funeral erm and people at the ten 
134,,,o’clock perhaps arrive and so they keep in their little groups they don’t 
135,,,want to mix with other people so the feeling of keeping them segregated 
136,,,just because they don’t know the other people might also be there and we 
137,,,do have problems with families like that during funerals they don’t 
138,,,want to be [laughs]
139,,Chris,police attendants [laughs]
140,,Angela,police attendants quite often you know you’d think it would bring 
141,,,them together but it actually makes it worse
142,,Adrian,really gosh
143,,Angela,yeah and they sit separately in the chapel as well it’s all to do with 
144,,,money and you know they’ve left someone something wonderful 
145,,,that’s most of the time what it is or the other family are cross because 
146,,,one family has arranged it and they used  they never visited her while she 
147,,,was alive and how dare they get involved with this and it all escalates
148,,Peter,it’s like east eastenders [all laugh]
149,0:14:00,Angela,indeed I mean yes it can escalate to sort of violence at times not here so 
150,,,far but threats of it at times so the idea that number one we have people 
151,,,for other services arriving perhaps at the same time they want to keep 
152,,,separate families like to keep separate and also the fact that perhaps 
153,,,people are waiting for lifts or other things as well perhaps they’ve had 
154,,,the service and they come back in the waiting room to wait for someone 
155,,,to pick them up or just because they’re waiting for the taxi or 
156,,,something
157,,Adrian,ok
158,,Angela,so I’d like it a little bit bigger I think + not hugely because there is it is 
159,,,a wasted space most of the day really 
160,,Adrian,Yeah well I would have thought another couple of metres on there [writes 
161,,,on drawing] would do the trick so shall we agree a two meter extension 
162,,,yes or thereabouts hmm
163,,Angela,I mean the other suggestion that perhaps I could make at this stage 
164,,,would be perhaps for a small amount of outside seating because people 
165,0:15:00,,like to smoke at funerals they like to have a and the seat that we’ve got 
166,,,out by the car park at the moment the half seat even if it’s cold and not 
167,,,very nice is actually people feel more happier out there then they do 
168,,,sometimes in the waiting room
169,,Adrian,yes well we can certainly add some outdoor seating out here if you 
170,,,wish we have got some outdoor seating here we’ve got a number of 
171,,,benches there erm but we can add-
172,,Angela,people like to
173,,Adrian,more in this area if you wish
174,,Angela,especially if we have a no smoking policy in the waiting room which 
175,,,we have now people like to mess up our grounds with their cigarette 
176,,,ends +++ just a thought that they also don’t like they don’t know where 
177,,,they’re going most of the time even if you were to point them in the right 
178,,,direction and they feel frightened most people attend the funeral don’t 
179,,,want to actually be right next to the family because they don’t want to be 
180,,,in their face and they don’t want to get involved with it but they want to 
181,,,attend the funeral and so it’s awkward they want to stand back a bit they 
182,,,want to be seen that they’re there but they actually don’t want to actually 
183,,,even perhaps sometimes speak to the other people you know so they quite 
184,0:16:00,,often hang back a bit and so the idea of putting here [gestures over 
185,,,drawing] would be quite nice because they wouldn’t they could see the 
186,,,funeral arrive and then they could sort of still stay here it’s like getting 
187,,,them into the chapel but we’ll talk about that once we get to that stage we 
188,,,can’t get them to move up front because I don’t know them that well you 
189,,,know that sort of thing I’m just saying what happens at a funeral they say 
190,,,oh I don’t really know them that well I’m not related to them and so if 
191,,,they’re here they’re important people for attending a funeral but they 
192,,,actually don’t particularly want to be that far up the front they don’t 
193,,,want to be sort of the people that they have to deal with the main 
194,,,mourner
195,,Adrian,OK ++
196,,Angela,so it would be nice to do something
197,,Adrian,yes + so having got this this far we’ve got a bigger waiting room loos and 
198,,,loos also using for disabled persons in the porte cochere we’ve got a 
199,,,grand porte cochere it’s wider than the existing porte cochere erm I think 
200,,,last time you commented that was quite a nice idea again people can mill 
201,0:17:00,,around here [gestures with pen] and wait and the way it’s designed at the 
202,,,moment they can wait and enjoy the pond [points] look at this area look 
203,,,at the planting and erm ++
204,,Angela,the funeral directors are a little bit concerned about that with regard to 
205,,,their access for their hearses that’s one of the comments that we’ve 
206,,,had and so we’ll need to get some sort of feedback as to what they 
207,,,perhaps need to do I mean obviously in a sense what they’re concerned 
208,,,about is if they’re coming down here [points] they’ll probably only get 
209,,,their hearses around to this area to carry in
210,,Adrian,that wasn’t the idea I was anticipating that the hearses would be 
211,,,parked here [sketches]
212,,Angela,were there OK that’s fine yeah
213,,Adrian,exactly as they are at the moment that the coffin would be drawn out 
214,,,here and they would simply [points] walk it in I wasn’t thinking that 
215,,,they’d try and park
216,,Angela,no that’s OK
217,,Adrian,in there
218,,Angela,yes well that’s what they’re wondering how that would work then so 
219,,,we’d work I wasn’t quite aware
220,,Adrian,we’d work it exactly the same way as the present system I mean 
221,,,maybe this should be made more obvious by perhaps a different colour 
222,0:18:00,,in the paving or something [sketches] I mean what I’m trying to say here 
223,,,is that that’s the vehicular line [sketches]
224,,Angela,yes
225,,Adrian,and that these areas [points] are for people to mill about in and you’ve got 
226,,,a place for people to stand
227,,Angela,yes they will probably want to know how [points] how + how  far that is 
228,,,from the because they’re going to be possibly carry the coffins in and 
229,,,most of the men are sort of in their seventies and eighties [laughs]
230,,,carrying the coffin
231,,Adrian,that’s only eight metres there’s not a huge difference
232,,Angela,that’s alright so long as I yes I mean they’re not criticising they’re 
233,,,just wondering how the flow of vehicles goes and where I mean 
234,,,they’re looking at it from their angle we’re looking at it obviously 
235,,,trying to make sure everything’s covered so they wanted to know 
236,,,roughly where they went how would they park how would they then 
237,,,offload the coffin normally by carrying on what we call shoulders so 
238,,,they would carry on a shoulder so that then obviously the area the 
239,,,length of that is important to them
240,,Chris,the other thing is they could use a bier
241,0:19:00,Angela,they could use a bier yes they don’t particularly like to they find it 
242,,,undignified some of them at the moment ++
243,,Adrian,to use a trolley
244,,Angela,a trolley yes I mean it’s health and safety it’s much easier for them to do 
245,,,that and the original concept of this chapel was that the bier the 
246,,,catafalque would actually come out and meet the hearse and it would 
247,,,be put on to the catafalque and then they would then wheel that in on 
248,,,there and so that was the original idea but that never really worked
249,,Chris,mainly because of the funeral directors
250,,Angela,funeral directors and the fact that they’ve always carried coffins in 
251,,,through churches and things like that there’s still this concept of doing 
252,,,it of sort of shouldering them carrying them in
253,,Chris,I think I mean the idea would still be that that would be the a flat 
254,,,route through [points]
255,,Angela,yes
256,,Chris,for a
257,,Adrian,yes (  ) a flat route through
258,,Angela,but they just wanted to know as to where they would I mean although 
259,,,I actually haven’t that’s my fault I remembered that from my 
260,,,discussion so that was they just wanted to know where do they park 
261,,,their vehicle [gestures] do they come round and they’re looking at it from 
262,0:20:00,,their side so that’s important to them that we make sure we you know
263,,Chris,the other thing if you’ve got erm several funeral vehicles cars carrying 
264,,,mourners they were coming through it as well [points] they’re currently 
265,,,how do they sort themselves out if there’s more than say four four of 
266,,,them
267,,Angela,yes what happens [gestures] on the existing site is that we that the hearse 
268,,,draws up as the main vehicle and we can get two [begins to point] 
269,,,limousines side by side underneath the erm porte-cochere and then one 
270,,,area by here as well so we can get two limousines underneath the covered 
271,,,area and one just under here which is why we’ve got the stepping stone 
272,,,sort of paving slab by my office out there so that if they it’s not wide 
273,,,enough for them to open the door and to get on to the path or road they 
274,,,have to get on to the grass area on this side ++++
275,,Adrian,I’ve shown four metres there which is + a bit tight for two cars to park 
276,0:21:00,,side by side so would you like me to widen this [writes] +
277,,Angela,I don’t if the if the the hearse will draw up to possibly they will draw it up 
278,,,to about here [points] and then as long as sort of a couple of vehicles can 
279,,,get underneath here the majority of them are I would say two hearse 
280,,,funerals
281,,Chris,two car
282,,Angela,two cars two limousines and the hearse so you’ve got three vehicles the 
283,,,majority very rarely do you get three family cars erm but obviously if 
284,,,you’ve still got space to carry them down one here one here as well then 
285,,,that’s enough room then to meet
286,,Adrian,if if the hearse moved up a little bit further [begins to sketch] and there 
287,,,was coffin space there you would have space for 
288,,Angela,space for those above the coffin area yes
289,,Adrian,side by side here
290,,Angela,yes and you’ve got to obviously allow for the doors to open for them 
291,,,to get out easily
292,,Adrian,yes I’m sure there’s space for that
293,,Angela,I’m sure there is and then like I say if there’s another limousine here 
294,,,then that would be in a sense like we have at the moment
295,,Adrian,so you could put a third one here if you wanted
296,,Angela,yes so that’s what they’re looking at from their side is how do they 
297,,,arrive where do they put their vehicles and how easy is the access into 
298,0:22:00,,the chapel so that’s what their remit is to look at that ++
299,,Adrian,OK so you didn’t see any alterations necessary to make that work
300,,Angela,not no as long as there’s a that’s what they’re I mean if we have a sort of 
301,,,consultation meeting with them that’s what they will be interested in 
302,,,they’ll be slightly interested in this side but they are only interested in 
303,,,how they arrive how do they offload the coffin how do they deal with that 
304,,,into the chapel and sort of how do they then get their vehicles to the 
305,,,wreath court which is the other issue that they’ve got but we’ll get there 
306,,,when we get to that bit 
307,,Adrian,OK my only point is that it would be relatively simple to widen that 
308,,,[points] a wee bit if that was helpful to you
309,,Angela,yes
310,,Chris,I think it possibly would be
311,,Angela,yes [points] in a sense to just these bits here what is- is that-
312,,Adrian,this is a planting bed at the moment so it would be quite simple to 
313,,,widen it a wee bit [sketches] if you thought it was helpful but
314,,Angela,so what we have is the [points] doors open here so they’re opened on to 
315,,,this side and people can get access but because they’ve left the doors 
316,0:23:00,,open wide enough here on this side at the moment they’re not wide 
317,,,enough and so we’ve had to put like a little paving area here that’s not  
318,,,particularly attractive so it’s got to be wide enough for people to have 
319,,,the doors open and also wheelchair access sometimes that’s what we’re 
320,,,looking at people obviously arriving in wheelchair vehicles as well and 
321,,,sometimes you get limousines and then you get perhaps a disabled bus 
322,,,as well for people being delivered funerals +
323,,Adrian,OK [begins to point] so having got this far everyone is now under cover 
324,,,at this point erm + the way it’s designed at the moment the roof edge is 
325,,,actually on this line here + so that’s the bit that covers you OK so that is a 
326,,,length of about nine nine metres or so OK + from this point you go 
327,0:24:00,,through a lobby into the chapel and the chapel layout is quite similar to 
328,,,the existing chapel where it gets different is that we have what I call a 
329,,,sanctuary to one side or an ante chapel for the very small funerals and we 
330,,,have a much more dominant catafalque design at the end
331,,Angela,thank you yes
332,,Adrian,erm last time we spoke Angela you thought that that the original 
333,,,catafalque design just wasn’t bold enough
334,,Angela,here wasn’t enough
335,,Adrian,yes
336,,Angela,yes
337,,Adrian,it just you know I felt that architecturally it needed to be a great deal 
338,,,more bold to make a statement about it being a very important
339,,Angela,that’s in a sense what they are all there for is what’s on that compared 
340,,,to to look at it and to focus their feelings on that area really that’s what 
341,,,they’re there for whether they want to or not ha ha ha 
342,,Adrian,so my next two questions are are the sanctuary and the catafalque big 
343,,,enough erm coming to the catafalque first last time I spoke to you with 
344,0:25:00,,mister (  ) he was saying that erm there might be the possibility of a 
345,,,double funeral in which case would this be wide enough for two
346,,,coffins ++
347,,Angela,it wouldn’t probably I don’t know 
348,,Adrian,it’s just over three metres diameter it’s about three point one metres 
349,,,diameter
350,,Chris,how wide is the existing er trolley
351,,Angela,I don’t know I think I would say it might just I mean at the moment they 
352,,,can just they can just go in side by side but it’s difficult to squeeze in to 
353,,,put the coffins on at the moment even because you’ve also you’ve got the 
354,,,two catafalques in side by side and you need to have four routes for 
355,,,people to go either you need the one in the middle for both people to go 
356,,,and the ones at the end for them to drop the coffins off erm but even two 
357,,,catafalques isn’t always enough we’ve had three or we’ve had car 
358,,,accidents you know we’ve had three coffins and we’ve not been able to 
359,,,accommodate all the you know I mean if we can do two that’s the 
360,0:26:00,,majority of them put them side beside or in the sense perhaps have the 
361,,,catafalque so it can expand to accommodate two I don’t know one 
362,,,catafalque that spreads out like a sort of a table or something I don’t 
363,,,know
364,,Adrian,OK I thought the catafalque was the name of the space it’s obviously 
365,,,the actual thing that you put the coffins on
366,,Angela,the actual thing yes some people call it like an altar the catafalque is 
367,,,the actual place erm where you place the coffin
368,,Adrian,OK so my question for you is how wide would it need to be for two 
369,,,coffins or if we’re going for two it would need to be
370,,Angela,we’ll have a measure up on that
371,,Chris,[points] there’s also the entrance as well isn’t there and how it fits in and 
372,,,how it’s visible
373,,Angela,how it would be visible for people on the corners
374,,Chris,in there maybe that side of the design would need to be cut back a bit 
375,,,but still maintain-
376,,Adrian,well [begins to sketch] there’s a couple of things I can do I can make the 
377,,,whole thing bigger for a start to help you make this work I can also splay 
378,0:27:00,,the opening a little bit wider as well so you’ve got an even better view in 
379,,,if that helps and that would certainly enable you to get a wider catafalque 
380,,,inside there that might be suitable for two people the architectural 
381,,,idea here is to have like a cylinder which will be top lit at the top 
382,,,perhaps a glass pyramid something like that so you can get top light 
383,,,pouring down into it there might be some very nice artificial lighting 
384,,,inside as well to (  ) that so that erm [phone rings] oh I’m 
385,,,terribly sorry rule number one  turn your mobile phone off when you 
386,,,have an important meeting
387,,Angela,might be Ben ++++
388,,Adrian,[operates mobile phone] it is Ben +++++ just turn it off so it doesn’t 
389,,,happen again so if you’d like me to increase the size of that space I 
390,,,certainly can do
391,0:28:00,Angela,how many people would you get on the seats roughly how many
392,,Chris,are we going to have fixed seating
393,,Angela,I don’t know that’s the next sort of thought I was-
394,,Adrian,its one of your questions isn’t it
395,,Angela,yes
396,,Adrian,[begins to write] seating
397,,Angela,I’m just trying to think if people are at the end of those seating they 
398,,,also need to be able to see the coffin because they tend to sort of not 
399,,,really work out you know the importance of which mourner sits where 
400,,,really they tend to just scrabble on to the seats as best they can there’s no 
401,,,set defining you know the main mourner sits on one end they tend to 
402,,,shuffle all up on one seat at the front erm and so as long as they can see 
403,,,coffin from where they’re sitting it’s obviously that’s the most 
404,,,important thing just briefly to mention with this that was received 
405,,,quite with the people that I’d spoken to as a very nice area they felt 
406,,,that was very good they only thing they had was would there be a door 
407,,,on that so that there would I mean how open would it be in the sense 
408,,,that if the service was going on in a normal chapel obviously is that sort of 
409,0:29:00,,something that people could see into or would it be a closed off area 
410,,,that can be-
411,,Adrian,I didn’t see it as being a doored off space I mean rather like an 
412,,,antechapel in a cathedral or whatever I just saw it as a space that you 
413,,,could walk in to 
414,,Angela,yes that’s fine
415,,Adrian,er is that how you saw
416,,Angela,yes yes that was kind of positive they felt that was quite a nice idea to do 
417,,,that especially for the childrens’ funeral we have the hospital chaplain 
418,,,that does all the babies funerals from the hospital and you know you 
419,,,only get mum and dad on that if at the most and it would be nice to be 
420,,,able to do that whether that would be for a full adult coffin I don’t 
421,,,know whether that was the design of it no 
422,,Adrian,don’t think don’t think that wouldn’t work it’s actually quite a small 
423,,,space and again I’m wondering if it needs to be increased in size we 
424,,,certainly can increase it in size at the moment it has a diameter of about 
425,,,three point one metres so there’s a floor area of really seven square metres 
426,,,so by the time you’ve got three people in there and a small coffin perhaps 
427,0:30:00,,for a child or something that’s filled the space up
428,,Angela,yes but it’s still (  ) at that it was thought of as being very nice 
429,,,you know a nice area even hmmm
430,,Adrian,so what would your view would be on that do you think we should 
431,,,increase it in size
432,,Angela,I would be concerned that if we make it too big it loses it’s sort of
433,,Adrian,intimacy
434,,Angela,yes yes you know I’m not sure I quite like it being a small space in a 
435,,,sense so I mean see whether that maybe just a little bit bigger but I’m 
436,,,quite happy with that as it is really I quite like the idea of a smaller 
437,,,place so the intimacy on that
438,,Adrian,well it would give me reassurance if maybe you could chalk out a three 
439,,,point one diameter circle on the ground somewhere 
440,,Angela,yes so we can see-
441,,Adrian,and and + perhaps we’ll all have a look at it and 
442,,Angela,see how big that is
443,,Adrian,see what you think
444,,Angela,as I say a little bit bigger maybe but-
445,,Chris,how many people come to those sort of services
446,,Angela,what to the babies ones mum and dad and the hospital chaplain and 
447,,,the chapel attendant
448,,Chris,no grandparents or-
449,,Angela,very rarely very rarely not very often sometimes you get lots but then 
450,0:31:00,,you’d use the main chapel for that and again the suit to the catafalque 
451,,,in that area then needs to be adaptable so that it doesn’t get lost on 
452,,,there we know and some adaption needs to be made so that cushions 
453,,,or something’s made so it’s not seen as little tiny coffin on the big 
454,,,chapel you know you get occasionally you get lots of people for them
455,,Chris,yes so we need to check that dimension works don’t we
456,,Angela,yes yes at the moment what happens with the ones from the hospital is 
457,,,that they go on to the main catafalque on to a cushion and then the mum 
458,,,and dad and the hospital chaplain will go round into the curtained off 
459,,,area stand around there with chairs and candles and sit there so the the
460,,,dimensions of the area that we’ve got in our existing chapel at the 
461,,,moment is more than enough for what they do then so probably 
462,,,although it’s oblong this is obviously about the same sort of size I 
463,,,would think yes we need to have a think about that
464,,Chris,yes this connection point for us to do is check that size
465,,Adrian,ok
466,0:32:00,Angela,I can’t work in metres
467,,Adrian,alright we’ll try and convert it to-
468,,Angela,no no no I must do I must do I’m not you know three metres I have to 
469,,,think about it
470,,Adrian,nine feet
471,,Angela,that’s alright then that’s OK [writes]
472,,Adrian,OK + did you see this as a space that might have it’s own small lectern in 
473,,,it or some altar like feature inside it
474,,Angela,it would be nice to have something like that yes I think we talked 
475,,,About erm perhaps doing something with it in a sense of erm coloured 
476,,,glass or something coming through didn’t we
477,,Adrian,definitely I’ve showed
478,,Angela,I’m thinking of coventry cathedral with the 
479,,Adrian,oh yeah I know what you mean I’ve shown a very tall narrow slitty 
480,,,window which faces directly south if my orientation is correct or is it 
481,,,west
482,,Angela,little bit that’s north [gestures] that would be north up this way +
483,,Adrian,it faces directly
484,,Angela,south-west +
485,0:33:00,Adrian,it faces directly west to get the setting sun in it that was the original 
486,,,idea I wanted to give you a small view of the pond as you came in and 
487,,,you get a small view through it of the pond but if it’s stained glass it’ll 
488,,,be a much more intimate space again top lit so you get sun and feeling 
489,,,of any cloud movement overhead but essentially it’s a very private 
490,,,sanctuary that’s why it’ll be the sanctuary on the plan
491,,Angela,yes I’m very pleased with that yes
492,,Adrian,if you want to we could puncture the wall with some more ++ holes if 
493,,,you like what I’m thinking of is like le corbusier’s chapel at 
494,,,ronchamp I’m not sure if you’re familiar with that this chapel has some 
495,,,[begins to sketch] holes that might have a tiny bit of stained glass in them 
496,,,but might in three dimensions look something like that so that if that’s the 
497,0:34:00,,outside and this is the inside you got small amount of covered light 
498,,,reflecting itself off the walls
499,,Angela,what into a deep a deep wall
500,,Adrian,a deep wall it’s a very deep wall walls at least three hundred millimetres
501,,,thick there and it would be there would be the opportunity to have the 
502,,,odd small piece of glass that might let a little splash of colour in-
503,,Angela,yes that would also be nice because if the water there’s a sense also that 
504,,,would also make the light move in a way through the glass if it was 
505,,,coloured you know you’d get the water as it moves or reflects as well 
506,,,then that changes the +
507,,Adrian,yeah I know what you mean particularly if some of these were 
508,,,relatively low you might get a reflection from any movement in /the 
509,,,water\
510,,Angela,/the water\
511,,Adrian,I saw the pond initially as being quite still but there’s no reason why it 
512,,,couldn’t have a fountain in it or something to give it
513,,Angela,yes but even if it was still I would think it would be something 
514,,,reflective wouldn’t it even through the light from the you know yes 
515,,,I’m quite keen on sort of developing that that erm that’s one of our 
516,,,unique sort of things not many I don’t know of any other crematorium 
517,,,chapel that’s got something as unique as that so you know I’m very keen 
518,,,to sort of keep that in there and use that 
519,,Adrian,good so in principle you really like the idea of its spirituality being 
520,,,amplified to make it very calm 
521,,Angela,yes
522,,Adrian,and spiritual
523,,Angela,yes
524,,Adrian,relaxing
525,,Angela,yes
526,,Adrian,meditative sort of space
527,,Angela,yes not even necessarily particularly for funerals but for sort of 
528,,,memorial services or something that people could come to later or some 
529,,,area to come and visit to spend some time people sometimes like 
530,,,coming back in the chapel and you know when we’ve got no services 
531,,,on for sort of private reflection or something so there’s nothing saying 
532,,,that they couldn’t do that but that would allow them to have an area as 
533,,,well that they could also just sit in quietly and sort of that would be 
534,,,quite nice 
535,,Adrian,and should it therefore include perhaps some built in seating a built in 
536,,,bench for a couple of people or /something like that\
537,,Angela,/something like that\ yes something whereas you know the seating that we 
538,0:36:00,,might go for whatever something around the edge so there’s definitely 
539,,,one at the city centre church that I remember I remember that there’s an 
540,,,area there that you can it’s a circular area you can pull the door round and 
541,,,close it but whether it’s still there or not I don’t know you can cut it 
542,,,off the door 
543,,Chris,I sort of vaguely recall it
544,,Angela,yeah I can’t remember a hundred percent its been quite a while since 
545,,,I’ve been there I have enough religion during the day ha ha ha I’m 
546,,,religioned out by the end of the day
547,,Adrian,yeah +
548,,Angela,OK
549,,Adrian,OK well that’s helpful we’ve dealt with the sanctuary now we’ve dealt 
550,,,with this area you know all about the audio visual room which hasn’t 
551,,,changed since the previous submission
552,,Angela,OK
553,,Chris,we’ve got an issue (  ) considering following a training session 
554,,,that the staff went on this week at erm stevenage crematorium to look 
555,0:37:00,,at use of the audio the new audio digital audio system that had been 
556,,,installed and a particular issue is the accommodation and [begins to 
557,,,gesture] having accommodation where they can work almost like a theatre 
558,,,technician so that they can be part of the service yet be divorced from the 
559,,,service so that they can operate PCs and things erm but also be in sight of 
560,,,what’s going on so being more involved so we’re currently looking at 
561,,,bringing stuff out the back of the existing chapel so that they can sit at a 
562,,,desk away but part of 
563,,Adrian,well well that’s the desk [begins to point] that I thought they could work 
564,,,at I saw this as being combined organ and AV control so someone might 
565,,,sit here and play the organ and there might be AV controls here but 
566,,,essentially all the spaghetti and all the amplifiers and CD players cassette 
567,0:38:00,,players you name it computers and so on and so forth could be in here
568,,Chris,hmm
569,,Adrian,but there’s no reason why there couldn’t be a small laptop or whatever 
570,,,attached to that system
571,,Chris,yeah I’m with you ++ yes I mean yes I mean you saw how the system (  )
572,,Angela,yes I would have to say [begins to write] that what I would ask if possible 
573,,,is that we swap these two bits around in a sense that we have sort of the 
574,,,the room here so that we can see across here cause at the moment if we 
575,,,were working the laptop what we what we felt here the staff feel is that 
576,,,people come to a funeral and they don’t particularly want to see someone 
577,,,sitting at a laptop doing tippy tap tippy tap like that and they felt that that 
578,,,was perhaps erm the concern we had so the idea is of in a sense is hiding 
579,,,that although it’s obviously a modern an idea 
580,,Adrian,you could hide them in there [points] (  ) visual link
581,,Angela,the problem with that would be yes they wouldn’t be able to see into 
582,,,the chapel that was the only thing there
583,0:39:00,Adrian,that’s a difficult one because if they can see out then people would be 
584,,,able to see in
585,,Angela,well the mirrored glass is what we’re looking at doing having 
586,,,installation of a mirrored glass system whereby people wouldn’t 
587,,,actually see you sitting in there working it typing tapping things in so 
588,,,that’s one of the things that we felt perhaps for our existing chapel that 
589,,,we were keen on doing
590,,Chris,I mean this [begins to point] idea was based on our existing chapel it’s not 
591,,,going to work is it in our existing chapel as we thought it would
592,,Angela,no we have an awful lot of additional electronics that systems 
593,,,recording systems so that we can play all sorts of tapes musics 
594,,,et cetera erm recording the funeral as well we’re planning to record 
595,,,funerals for families on to CD disks and also the possibility of relaying 
596,,,the funeral over the web to other people that can’t make the funeral as 
597,,,well and that system is going to be up and running in our chapel so the 
598,0:40:00,,spaghetti and all the other software is quite vast and is at the moment 
599,,,sort of spoiling the appearance of our chapel + at the moment
600,,,and so we want to move it into a room that can’t be seen and hide it 
601,,,really that’s what we’re doing
602,,Adrian,that was the intention of that room that’s er-
603,,Angela,indeed and that was er yes yes so we’re looking at you know the 
604,,,concern I’ve got is in a sense that what I would like is just to have the 
605,,,organ here and everything else to do with the music system that we 
606,,,would work CD player MP3 player whatever now that we’re going to 
607,,,be doing is all in there
608,,Adrian,I think we’re thinking along the same lines I mean that was certainly 
609,,,my intention to have a minimum of controls in here [begins to point] the 
610,,,point I’m not quite getting my head around is whether you would want 
611,,,the person who controls this to be in here or sitting here certainly if he’s 
612,,,sat here he or she’s sat here then they could just operate a few controls 
613,,,that would remotely operate all the equipment in there and they would 
614,0:41:00,,obviously be part of the service but not necessarily clicking away on the 
615,,,keyboard the keyboard and stuff can certainly /be hidden in there\
616,,Angela,/be hidden in there\ OK
617,,Adrian,if they need to go away and do that they can sh- shut themselves in and 
618,,,do it
619,,Angela,OK
620,,Adrian,erm do you think that would work that way round
621,,Angela,yes I mean it wouldn’t be impossible yes I mean it was just the 
622,,Chris,I think there is because while they’re there [begins to point] I guess 
623,,,they’re not helping in dealing with this service but looking at the future 
624,,,services
625,,Angela,yes they’re getting ready prepared they might have had a disk brought 
626,,,in or there might be a request to sort of down I mean we could get it 
627,,,within the service times that’s the only thing
628,,Chris,and the other bonus of them not being actually sitting in there was that 
629,,,they could communicate then outside the other issue we looked at was 
630,,,because this person erm [begins to point] also is monitoring in the ideal 
631,0:42:00,,world what’s happening out here and what’s happening out here so ah 
632,,,they’re not only dealing with this the current funeral but the previous one 
633,,,and the one to come
634,,Angela,see when they’re arriving
635,,Adrian,[begins to sketch] the answer is then to have a door there
636,,Chris,a door
637,,Adrian,maybe a window 
638,,Chris,a window
639,,Adrian,and they can
640,,Chris,and a window this way
641,,Angela,to see when the next one’s arriving so you can see that the other one 
642,,,has arrived and they can get ready for that they can go out to the 
643,,,minister and go come on hurry up [laughs] so that’s what they what they 
644,,,what the staff would like would be to see the access at the moment 
645,,,because of [begins to point] the existing chapel we’re adding a room on to 
646,,,the back possibly they’ll be able to see down to the drive to see the next 
647,,,funeral arriving and know that it’s here and so that that’s that’s quite we 
648,,,thought about cameras and all sorts of things for that so that now would 
649,,,possibly do away with the thought of having cameras down the drive to 
650,0:43:00,,see the next funeral arriving and that’s why er the thought of having the 
651,,,door here might be better for us but I don’t know how that upsets the 
652,,,feeling of what you’ve got here and where the roof space is in a sense 
653,,,there the roof carries over from here doesn’t it
654,,Adrian,yes the roof flies over I would be resistant to having a 
655,,Angela,yes
656,,Adrian,door there because I think it would spoil the you know the chapel
657,,Angela,it’s not a door but a small room for the music room the music room is
658,,,sort of swinging round a bit here instead but I don’t know how that 
659,,,would spoil the feeling for that not wanting to disrupt too much
660,,Adrian,yes if I could go back to the architectural concept [pulls out drawing] on 
661,,,that show you where I’m coming from I’ve done these concept diagrams 
662,,,to try and explain how what holds the architecture together because the 
663,,,building as I mentioned before is a combination of four strips of what we 
664,,,call servant space which are low spaces and three strips of served space 
665,,,which are the barrel vaulted spaces and you put those together and you 
666,,,get this combination of ser- servant served servant served servant 
667,,,served and servant so I’ve been trying my hardest to keep all the 
668,,,important spaces like the chapel and things (  ) entrance so on 
669,,,and so forth vestry and the major staff rooms that more important 
670,,,spaces under the barrel vaults and keep all the supporting 
671,,,accommodation under the served if we then went back to the plan 
672,,,having explained that [replaces drawing] you know what I can do to 
673,,,make your idea work is to suggest that we do something like this [begins 
674,,,to sketch] and make this all perhaps one room and put a window in there 
675,,,and then you can get access through here and you can get a view out that 
676,,,way erm you could have a door this side if that helps you but erm I think 
677,,,that might satisfy your needs +++
678,,Chris,it probably needs to be open in terms of 
679,0:45:00,Adrian,mutually (  ) glazed or do you want a view is that the sort of thing you 
680,,,want 
681,,Chris,yes
682,,Angela,you don’t want a door because that would just mean the funeral 
683,,,directors in and out in and out all the time and they should be in there 
684,,,anyway
685,,Chris,well [points] no I mean there
686,,Angela,from this side I don’t want particularly a door [points] because it’s also 
687,,,going to
688,,Adrian,a short cut yeah
689,,Angela,it’s also going to [begins to point] interrupt this flow of space here as well 
690,,,isn’t it a door people sort of popping in and out there it looks like that 
691,,,might be the entrance to the chapel or not too sure so the less doors we 
692,,,have I mean the door that you want is just the exit door if you put 
693,,,another door up there people are going to start thinking you know 
694,,,we’re late for the funeral if we tap on this door here rather than going 
695,,,round to the right door it would be all over the place really the more 
696,,,doors we have the more confusing it gets for people one door in one 
697,,,door out basically is the easiest route for people add another door and 
698,,,they’ll just go oh what’s that + there was a toilet there that was quite-
699,,Adrian,you’ve still got another toilet there
700,,Angela,that’s OK
701,0:46:00,Adrian,I gave you two before but maybe you only need one I mean you’ve got 
702,,,two [points] at the entrance another one here so there’s not actually any 
703,,,shortage of loos so 
704,,Angela,OK yes yes that would be fine
705,,Adrian,we could do that ++ and then-
706,,Angela,what were your thoughts Chris on that do you think that’s + I mean I 
707,,,think that would be +++ (you see the next)
708,,Chris,hmmm the only concern I’ve got is [begins to point] if we’re moving a 
709,,,person from inside to here ++++ it’s how they monitor what’s going on 
710,,,here from this position + the advantage of having it here is the door can 
711,,,be open + unless they’re doing something noisy then just close the door
712,,Angela,yes
713,,Chris,er it’s then how they monitor what’s going on here I don’t know how 
714,,,theatre technicians do that are they completely enclosed or have they 
715,0:47:00,,got some sort of sliding window type of thing so that they can slide it 
716,,,shut +++ er I mean I know sound engineers are in the they like to be 
717,,,within the audience but I mean we’re not at that level
718,,Angela,not yet [all laugh] feels a bit like that at the moment yes it 
719,,,feels like there will be mixing desks that’s all we need ++
720,,Adrian,well there might be another way of looking at this if you specifically 
721,,,wanted a theatre technicians room then I could look into putting another 
722,,,sort of bold architectural shape in this vicinity that might satisfy what 
723,,,you’re looking for where the guy would literally sit in there and he 
724,,,would look straight forward perhaps through some covered glass 
725,,,or mirrored glass or whatever erm ++ and I might still be able to integrate 
726,0:48:00,,it into the architectural form I’ve got other bold forms on this axis I’m 
727,,,thinking I might be able to do something here that might satisfy that 
728,,,need erm without making it look like an afterthought that’s not what I 
729,,,imagined this elevation would look like at all +
730,,Chris,no I mean it might be- ++
731,,Adrian,if you don’t think this could work I mean I’m still struggling to get my 
732,,,head around exactly how you see this working coz I always thought 
733,,,that we’d need an organ here anyway would we not 
734,,Chris,an organ is now a very rarely used
735,,Angela,rarely used item
736,,Adrian,would you not want an organ
737,,Angela,well I + I don’t know it’s difficult to say not I mean most of (  ) 
738,,,could bring a keyboard in in a sense so it’s not + hmm difficult I 
739,,,would have to say that we wouldn’t need an organist but at the same 
740,0:49:00,,time people expect us to get one they expect one to be here just for the 
741,,,thought of they don’t like the idea of us playing a CD for a hymn 
742,,,instead +++
743,,Adrian,so so there’s this this a need for something there which would relate to 
744,,,AV in some way 
745,,Chris,well I mean the other thing is if if there’s going to be slideshows video 
746,,,which is increasingly becoming you know people almost expect it that 
747,,,they I mean I’ve seen it at church services where for funerals where 
748,,,people have had you’ve walked into before a service a er a series of stills 
749,,,of the persons life erm and I think sort of thing is going to increase videos 
750,,,or there’s certainly erm books of photographs or display of photographs at 
751,0:50:00,,the back of a service things like that
752,,Angela,yes we’ve had a lot of cine films being played of people cause they’re 
753,,,obviously that sort of age perhaps or videos or sometimes they wanted 
754,,,their favourite video played we’ve had one or two sort of disney films 
755,,,played for the children’s funeral where there’s a lot of children they 
756,,,want a little bit of music played that’s on a video they’ve got so they’ve 
757,,,brought the video in to be played for the musics
758,,Adrian,[sketches] do we need some sort of surface around here where you can 
759,,,put a book or something that might form of this end elevation erm do we 
760,,,need some-
761,,Chris,no I-
762,,Angela,no
763,,Chris,I I think what we need is the flexibility in this space so the current 
764,,,chapel of course is not particularly flexible [points] this is all fixed 
765,,,pews there is for and against fixed pews isn’t there err-
766,,Angela,yes there is we do have this area here that they can put memorial 
767,0:51:00,,books for people to sign they can go in and sign them and then back 
768,,,out again so that’s not I’d quite like to use that space we’ve got
769,,Chris,yes it’s just yeah if we’re going to use if we’re going to have a 
770,,,screen for projected video whatever + whoever is operating that it might 
771,,,be the family I suppose but it might be you know they say have you 
772,,,got a video projector yes no what obviously operating that the person 
773,,,has got to know what’s going up on it and it’s working 
774,,Adrian,yeah
775,,Chris,so they’ve got to be in sight of it now I ass- I don’t know how we 
776,,,assume that would work in this arrangement
777,,Adrian,what I had in mind was that perhaps I need to draw on this section to 
778,,,show what it looks like [searches for drawings] + excuse me while I get 
779,,,my act together [searches for drawings]  I’ve got a sectional drawing here 
780,0:52:00,,somewhere + here we are right [pulls out drawing] at the bottom this 
781,,,shows that the shape of the chapel and what I wanted to
782,,,describe to you was what it might look like when you’re looking up at 
783,,,the catafalque [begins to sketch] because the catafalque itself will be like a 
784,,,cylinder poking through the chapel at the end like this have a large 
785,,,opening this will inside have its own and they’ll be a pyramid light or 
786,,,whatever so they’ll be light pouring into it like this but as regards the 
787,,,(internal) elevation of the chapel you will see the external you’ll see the 
788,,,form of the catafalque looking like this and I’ll just draw a curve in front 
789,0:53:00,,of it so you get an idea of what’s happening something like that this 
790,,,leaves you some large wall surfaces each side which are flat and at the 
791,,,bottom of them there maybe will be a space for a nice table where you 
792,,,could put books you could even have some plants or something but 
793,,,you’ve got the opportunity to have two perhaps parallel and matching 
794,,,screens that might be showing images of the person whose funeral it is at 
795,,,the same time you have a very dominant wall here where if you wanted 
796,,,for a religions person you could mount a cross or something something of 
797,,,that nature which could be removed for a non-religious person OK that’s 
798,,,how I saw it working does that sound OK [pulls out drawing]
799,,Angela,yes that’s what we’re looking for but the concern that we have at the 
800,,,moment is whoever is operating and perhaps working some of this the 
801,0:54:00,,video they need to be able to see sort of in a sense rather than just at an 
802,,,angle so what what in an ideal world and I don’t want to compromise 
803,,,your design the door the viewing room at the existing site which is very 
804,,,similar to this we are putting on here so that we can then see down that 
805,,,way so I’m trying to think of a way that we can get them to look 
806,,,through maybe at this angle through here that’s what I’m looking at so 
807,,,they’re able to view near enough both sides of the chapel
808,,Adrian,yeah [begins to sketch] I wonder if it’s possible to do something like that 
809,,,where they’d have a sort of vision spot through there
810,,Angela,yes
811,,Adrian,I mean if I made this feel like a room with its own lid on it that was 
812,,,inside the chapel that was just token toke tucking its nose into the 
813,,,chapel we might be able to get it to work it does go slightly against the 
814,,,grain for me to do that but it does satisfy what you wanted and it means 
815,,,that we could link this up to it actually so- ++++++
816,0:55:00,Angela,OK is that too heartbreaking for you [all laugh]
817,,Adrian,well it’s not as pure a summation as I was looking for but I mean 
818,,,maybe there’s another way of doing it maybe if I keep my thinking cap 
819,,,on because you can see I’m trying to keep the spaces pure the 
820,,,purer the space the more spiritual I think it will be the more you mess 
821,,,around with it 
822,,Chris,yes
823,,Angela,well that’s what we’ve found here you see we’re adding there’s like 
824,,,what I call a strap on all the time we keep adding little bits on to the 
825,,,building we’ve got the air-conditioning units
826,,Adrian,yeah I know
827,,Angela,you’ve got the different way of the planter in the chapel for me and so 
828,,,I want it to be nice straight smooth lines and I want it as nice as 
829,,,possible and I mean it’s just trying to work how to do that in a way I 
830,,,mean whether we have perhaps cameras or something I don’t know 
831,,,something in the way I don’t know the concern I’ve also got is I 
832,,,don’t know adding more to it if people are walking in I don’t know if 
833,,,people want to see if there’s a mirrored glass window in front of them 
834,,,whether they want to see to see reflections of themselves walking in 
835,,Adrian,hmmm
836,0:56:00,Angela,which is the other concern I’ve got in a sense do they actually want to 
837,,,see themselves walking in will they get themselves you know I don’t 
838,,,know so there’s this I don’t think it’s I don’t think it’s unsolvable 
839,,,through technology I’m sure we could solve it somehow either through 
840,,,cameras or other things it’s just that we’ve found this problem of 
841,,,viewing down into the chapel really 
842,,Chris,I mean the difficulty of putting someone separate in here is the volume 
843,,,as well isn’t it 
844,,Angela,yes we can’t hear what the volume is
845,,Chris,how do they adjust the volume if they’re not 
846,,Adrian,yes I would say [points] they need to be there really I mean I thought
847,,Chris,yes and maybe they need to be 
848,,Angela,in close from that
849,,Chris,so that they can’t be seen so it’s just their head sticking out over the 
850,,,top ++ maybe that’s the answer I mean it could be that 
851,,Angela,we don’t have
852,,Chris,a larger space is required 
853,,Angela,or we take the organ out don’t have the organ and use the space for 
854,0:57:00,,just the music system in a sense +++
855,,Chris,well how big does an organ have to be
856,,Angela,not very big at all now I mean the one we’ve got is sm- not that big at 
857,,,all it could be smaller even and some of them just have keyboards
858,,,you know I don’t know  if we didn’t have an organ then that facility is 
859,,,not available I mean it’s as simple as that really
860,,Adrian,[sketches] I keep coming back to some sort of other bold form here that 
861,,,might +do it erm ++ you’re looking for a space here + where some guy 
862,,,can + sit and do his business and view through without being seen aren’t 
863,,,you +++
864,,Chris,hmmm 
865,,Adrian,I mean if we have glass to the edges then it doesn’t work here because 
866,,,it’s behind the door 
867,0:58:00,Peter,you have sliding windows in the theatre don’t you
868,,Angela,yes ++
869,,Adrian,I don’t know trying to find some means of delivering what you want ++
870,,Chris,and we need to rethink what we want on this because + we don’t really 
871,,,we haven’t got a real handle on how much the technology actually has 
872,,,to be here but I think it’s going to be a PC 
873,,Angela,yeah ++ are we-
874,,Chris,I mean you’re talking about remote + if you’re talking about CDs and 
875,,Angela,and what’s next from CD is the MP3 sort of side of it and the WAV 
876,,,system that they’ve got you know things like that that are coming into 
877,,,it and so you know as technology moves on I can see-
878,,Chris,yes but is all that controllable from a single PC
879,,Angela,single PC
880,,Chris,I mean we are talking about it as a single PC because if you’re 
881,,,recording you have to have + you can just record digitally on to hard 
882,,,drive don’t you
883,0:59:00,Angela,yes
884,,Chris,if you’re then going to produce + a DVD or whatever from that 
885,,,information you don’t need to do that at the same time 
886,,Angela,no no we (  )
887,,Chris,you can go into the room and do that later 
888,,Angela,I mean in theory you’d record every service because do
889,,Chris,yes but you’d do it on to a hard drive
890,,Angela,yes because yeah not on a tape like they do at stevenage a cassette 
891,,,tape ++
892,,Peter,I’ve got the cameras if you want to- 
893,,Angela,and then after three months tape over the funerals if people haven’t 
894,,,requested it and then Anthony said well what happens if one of the 
895,,,services has longer you know you given it then to the (  ) do you 
896,,,check do you clear it completely or do you just overtape them so that 
897,,,you come to end of one service on the tape and you listen to it and then 
898,,,you’ve got the existing why put it on a tape well everyone has got a 
899,,,tape machine they said we all went have they nobody’s got one 
900,,,anymore and so I yes I don’t I I feel we’re making a fuss over perhaps 
901,1:00:00,,an area that we don’t need to perhaps now
902,,Chris,yes I think we’re looking at current
903,,Angela,we’re looking at current exists in our minds
904,,Chris,rather than future
905,,Angela,yes whereas in the future it might not really it might be that’s 
906,,,possibly more than enough really we’re talking about how quick we can 
907,,,keep up with the technology side of it and how big how as as- you know 
908,,,CDs have gone down to this much now you know how big the 
909,,,equipment will be that will need to press the start and record will be 
910,,,probably about that big soon
911,,Adrian,well that’s exactly the point I was going to make it may be in another 
912,,,few years someone dressed smartly can sit on the back pew with a tiny 
913,,,palm pilot and control everything 
914,,Angela,that’s it so that’s you know that’s what we’re looking at compared to 
915,,,[talks over]
916,,Chris,yes
917,,Angela,maybe we’re just going because what we’ve got to try and do is to 
918,,,think this isn’t the same as what we’ve got now we’ve got to stop 
919,,,doing that perhaps we’re thinking about it as now I think I think it will be 
920,,,more than fine as it is it’s just that we’re just thinking about how we 
921,1:01:00,,would look out into the chapel and see all this thing going on really and 
922,,,I think wouldn’t be difficult for us to do so 
923,,Adrian,but certainly the idea of having someone at the back here 
924,,,I’ve been to funerals at the present chapel and I never found it 
925,,,intrusive 
926,,Angela,no
927,,Adrian,someone sitting there you kind of expect it you kind of feel more 
928,,,reassured in a way where you know there’s someone overlooking 
929,,,what’s going on in case there’s some sort of problem of some kind erm +
930,,Angela,but what you don’t want them to do is play the music wrong like they 
931,,,did for your friends funeral
932,,Adrian,I know turn the volume down
933,,Angela,turn the volume down
934,,Adrian,during karl jenkins the armed man do you know the Benedictus do 
935,,,you know the armed man
936,,Peter,no I don’t
937,,Adrian,it starts off beautifully softly and suddenly the choir comes in 
938,,,fortissimo and the effect is tremendous 
939,,Angela,that was the idea wasn’t it
940,,Adrian,the technician turned the volume down as soon as the fortissimo came 
941,,,in
942,,Angela,they only wanted to hear it as loud you see so it wasn’t conveyed to us 
943,1:02:00,,and he thought ohhh better turn it down very loud they’ll get upset 
944,,,you know so he turned it down 
945,,Adrian,it completely spoiled the whole thing
946,,Angela,the effect so you know
947,,Adrian,deary me
948,,Angela,yeah I mean I don’t- there’s a possibility that when we start to 
949,,,actually start to do this we won’t have an organ if we don’t have an 
950,,,organ that won’t on offer in a sense you know if we put an organ there 
951,,,it might be used once or twice a week less than that so it might be that 
952,,,we don’t put an organ there and that’s it you know you don’t have a 
953,,,choice unfortunately we’ve got CDs that sound like an organ so we can 
954,,,use that space for other things
955,,Adrian,sure it makes sense to me to provide some sort of erm joinery there which 
956,,,might be a cupboard with a connection to a floor trunking or something 
957,,,that might route back to here so if someone wanted to bring a keyboard 
958,,,in they could plug it in and it would connect via this to the 
959,,,loudspeakers
960,,Angela,yes
961,,Chris,certainly one one major thing is that you need trunking between these 
962,,,two that’s easy to access 
963,1:03:00,Angela,easy to access and add to yeah so 
964,,Adrian,ok
965,,Angela,that’s what we’re looking at it from our chapel at the moment that’s 
966,,,the restriction we’ve got with this existing chapel and so that’s what 
967,,,we’re looking at really I suppose with this now is that we’re looking at 
968,,,that
969,,Adrian,yes so can I 
970,,Angela,maybe we don’t need to
971,,Adrian,yes so can I ask you to to write me a brief for that area then and I’ll 
972,,,leave that I won’t change anything there 
973,,Chris,no
974,,Adrian,until you have another conversation about it OK well lets move on 
975,,,then the way in which the circulation works here is very similar to the 
976,,,existing chapel in that once a service has ended erm people would 
977,,,leave through these doors we’ve given you double doors because of 
978,,,the draught issue that you have at the present chapel
979,,Angela,yes
980,,Adrian,and from here they can process around the wreath court even have a 
981,,,look around the garden and admire what we’ve what we’re trying to 
982,,,create around here with the exception of certain religions like Sikhs 
983,1:04:00,,that we understand like to push the coffin in where they would actually 
984,,,walk through here into the committal room
985,,Angela,hm hm
986,,Adrian,we’ve designed erm I’ve had a chat chat with a Sikh colleague of mine in 
987,,,the office and he’s explained that 
988,,Angela,mr opie
989,,Adrian,no not mr opie erm we call him Bash Bash Dar Singh and er Bash 
990,,,tells me that they do like to do that and so the next space I’ve created 
991,,,through here is a spiritual space again with the same sectional form as 
992,,,the chapel and it is is lit with roof lights in as the chapel is it is also 
993,,,right on the axis of the wreath court here and it would be a nice 
994,,,spiritual space might be spaces to put in flowers there might certainly 
995,,,be space where there’s stained glass around the doors and so on to 
996,,,make it another antechapel if you like cum committal room whereby the 
997,,,coffin will be placed on erm this the I can’t remember what they’ve 
998,,,called it’s the
999,,Angela,the trolley
1000,1:05:00,Adrian,trolley
1001,,Chris,it’s the charging
1002,,Angela,charging
1003,,Adrian,the charging device and the Sikh people would be allowed to push it 
1004,,,into the cremator OK beyond that of course we get to the back of 
1005,,,house we get to the cremator room
1006,,Angela,OK can I obviously ask it seems a completely daft thing but if people 
1007,,,are if Sikhs are walking through after the service they obviously need 
1008,,,to be able to get through the curtain if we’re using curtains as our 
1009,,,committal style at the moment once the curtains are closed you have to 
1010,,,go through the curtains to open them
1011,,Adrian,you don’t necessarily have to go that way 
1012,,Angela,no
1013,,Adrian,there are three possible routes they either come through here one or 
1014,,,they go through here two or they can go through there three
1015,,Angela,OK that’s alright lovely
1016,,Adrian,they’ve got three alternative ways of getting in so if there’s a 
1017,,,curtaining thing there yes you can certainly guide them through this 
1018,1:06:00,,way that might be the nicest way to come in but + yeah
1019,,Angela,that’s OK thank you ++
1020,,Adrian,now + beyond that I’ve put in a cremator area the last time you and I 
1021,,,talked about this we were changing away from the original idea of 
1022,,,having a cool storage area into full cremators and so we’ve developed 
1023,,,the design of this end of the building with facultieve facultatieve 
1024,,,technologies 
1025,,Angela,yes
1026,,Adrian,who’ve provided your present cremators and it’s all worked out in my 
1027,,,original concept as server and served so that you end up with a 
1028,,,chimney sticking out through the servant space and not through the very 
1029,,,nice barrel vaulted roofs
1030,,Angela,ok
1031,,Adrian,erm the service yard is located here if once this is built if you needed 
1032,,,to replace a cremator well into the future these doors have been 
1033,,,designed to be wide enough so that you can bring equipment in and 
1034,1:07:00,,replace it from the service yard the service yard has a staff entrance on 
1035,,,it which erm allows a connection for staff to the back of the building 
1036,,,if you like the staff entrance links them straight into the staff room 
1037,,,which has a kitchenette
1038,,Angela,very plush
1039,,Adrian,well last time we spoke you thought it was comfortable to have a space 
1040,,,like this because you said that there might be large families visiting 
1041,,,wanting to arrange a funeral and if you couldn’t get them into the office 
1042,,,for that purpose you could bring them in here
1043,,Angela,yes
1044,,Adrian,so just like this space this space here would double up as a kitchenette 
1045,,,staff room and meeting room for large meetings
1046,,Angela,you’ll be able to see like we can we can see the cremators from here 
1047,,,at the moment which is always  
1048,,Adrian,no you can’t see them from here 
1049,,Angela,no you can’t see them so that’s not a that’s an issue yeah that’s well 
1050,,,some people you know
1051,,Adrian,don’t want to see them
1052,,Angela,don’t want to see it you know 
1053,,Adrian,yes I can understand that 
1054,,Angela,they also see that there’s been you know we’re sitting here chatting 
1055,,,having tea coffee and lunch and that’s so that’s quite nice that you 
1056,,,don’t actually see  it although you’re near to it 
1057,,Adrian,just like this room you get a view out over the gardens in this 
1058,,,direction OK
1059,,Angela,OK
1060,1:08:00,Adrian,and er the staff wing this area if you like has all the staff (support) 
1061,,,accommodation they have their own disabled loo cleaners store 
1062,,,shower changing area at the end here you have a (coat) store couple of 
1063,,,ordinary loos and on the front of house the really posh bit you get 
1064,,,lovely views from both the vestry and the office over the pond and you 
1065,,,get a formal entrance lobby on this axis the vestry has its own WC so 
1066,,,that the clergyman or priest whoever’s taking the service can change 
1067,,,and so on and so forth
1068,,Angela,the men can put their make up on 
1069,,Adrian,absolutely very important I never go out without my lipstick
1070,,Angela,no that’s (another thing) that’s super OK yeah
1071,,Adrian,OK so + on the other side we have er plant accommodation here we have 
1072,,,the gas housing because there’s a huge incoming gas supply required 
1073,1:09:00,,we have electrical switch room general plant room and we have plant 
1074,,,required by facultatieve to support the cremator facilities here we’re 
1075,,,also showing an ashes store here and cremator er cremulator room
1076,,Angela,yes
1077,,Adrian,erm ++ and erm interesting as you talk about cremulators because in 
1078,,,facultieve  facultatieve technologies quote they talk about a 
1079,,,cremulator as an add on to the basic cremator facilities and I’m 
1080,,,wondering which way you wanted to go on that they seem to 
1081,,Angela,they’ve quite they haven’t quite got it sussed at the moment 
1082,,Adrian,so you could have your cremulator as a bit at the back of the cremator
1083,,Angela,yes what happens what happens is when you rake down you rake it in 
1084,,,to a cremulator on each machine so you don’t have the removal of 
1085,,,cremated remains until they’ve been cremulated and put in to a powder 
1086,,,it’s all done on the machine itself so you rake it in to an area and 
1087,,,obviously the problem with that is that there’s some issues with 
1088,1:10:00,,removal of large metal joints and hip joints and leg joints and other 
1089,,,things and also the concern of servicing each cremulator on each 
1090,,,machine quite a lot involved with it they haven’t got those quite up 
1091,,,and running at the moment so it could be by the time we get to this it 
1092,,,might be yep
1093,,Adrian,right we’ve allowed a cremulator room anyway if you want a separate 
1094,,,cremulator that would be like close raking erm + but that would probably 
1095,,,/used for storing\
1096,,Angela,/where would the\ operators would they have a separate office to sit in 
1097,,,to there’s a switch room control room would it be any an area or 
1098,,,would the operator sit within that one area
1099,,Adrian,we show a control desk here but certainly if you didn’t need a 
1100,,,cremulator room that could easily be converted into a control room you 
1101,,,could even have a glass wall on it if you wanted
1102,,Angela,are we talking about the room still being chilled there by the because 
1103,,,that was the original chill room wasn’t it but that’s not now going to 
1104,,,happen 
1105,,Adrian,no we don’t have a chill room we have coffins stores as such here 
1106,1:11:00,,because forgot to mention those the idea was that erm that if you did 
1107,,,have Sikh funeral you wouldn’t really want to see other coffins hanging 
1108,,,around the idea is that you would store coffins in racks in here
1109,,Angela,OK and we also do that during the day if we’ve got we’ve got two 
1110,,,cremators there have you on there or just the one
1111,,Adrian,there’s /two cremators\
1112,,Angela,/two cremators\ yep so you know like us we occasionally have to store 
1113,,,through the day in that sense and if we’re talking about moving forward 
1114,,,with changes we might store twenty four hours I’m not sure yet it 
1115,,,depends how much gas we can get everything else in the world 
1116,,Adrian,so those doors are there for you to enable you to tidy this up into a 
1117,,,very chapel like space erm if you wish to make sure the ambience is 
1118,,,right for a Sikh or similar funeral what other religions apply to do that 
1119,,,is it just the Sikhs or 
1120,,Angela,erm the erm + Hindus and also the erm the Chinese Buddhists 
1121,1:12:00,,sometimes like to do that and we also have people who think we do 
1122,,,things and they want to make sure that nothing’s done we have 
1123,,,ordinary people think it’s all going on here and they fairly convinced 
1124,,,and they’re determined to make sure that we don’t do the awful things 
1125,,,that they think we do we’ve had that more than once where they want 
1126,,,that so and then and again its something that’s again on offer people 
1127,,,should have the chance to see that we don’t have hidden agenda with 
1128,,,that so we have an open area we’re not hiding what we do +
1129,,Adrian,I’ve lost me agenda now
1130,,Angela,the only comment also I’ve had from the funeral directors I mean in a 
1131,,,sense would be is this route here slight concern for people over that 
1132,,,that’s not a big issue
1133,,Adrian,well this I see this as primarily an architectural feature because 
1134,,,obviously there are numerous ways of getting into this accommodation 
1135,,,that’s route number one  the second route is round the end of the pond 
1136,1:13:00,,and the third route is through the chapel so there’s numerous ways of 
1137,,,coming in
1138,,Angela,that’s fine
1139,,Adrian,I guess this is for the young and the brave but I mean as you’ve said if 
1140,,,they fall in it gives you  more custom [laughs] /gives you more business\
1141,,Angela,/you know keep our figures\ up that’s what want yes but you know it 
1142,,,was seen as a bit oh dear what a daft idea but I mean you can see the 
1143,,,route obviously like you said I can see what that’s doing it’s bring(ing) 
1144,,,that’s fine but I mean the majority of people that we get sometimes are 
1145,,,elderly and are slightly so I I mean until we actually start to look at the 
1146,,,materials and what we’re going to put in there it’s difficult to you 
1147,,,know the thought that people would be 
1148,,Chris,I think if we could put a bridge or something that looks like a bridge 
1149,,Adrian,you can have that as a bridge if you wanted not necessarily stepping 
1150,,,stones 
1151,,Chris,yeah I think a bridge would be
1152,,Angela,compromising your design all the time [laughs]
1153,,Adrian,its not necessarily a compromise but if there’s a good reason for 
1154,,,changing it lets change it I’ve always wanted to do a stepping stone 
1155,,,type bridge across a pond maybe this isn’t
1156,1:14:00,Angela,perhaps we can put glass inserts in you know they can it looks like 
1157,,Chris,it would be very slippy +++
1158,,Angela,oh he’s poo pooing the idea I don’t know but yes it would be nice to 
1159,,,have that I don’t see that that’s a problem but I can see that in the end 
1160,,,what will happen it will have to be taken away as just a design and /( )\
1161,,Chris,/there is one a very\ small one of these there was in erm the winter 
1162,,,garden wasn’t there
1163,,Adrian,was there
1164,,Chris,wasn’t there a winter garden in central milton keynes 
1165,,Adrian,I know the big (common) you mean I didn’t know there was a
1166,,,stepping stone running across it
1167,,Chris,there was a stream 
1168,,Adrian,oh right so you could walk through it
1169,,Chris,there was a stream running across and you came down into the winter 
1170,,,garden down the steps and you had to go across stepping stones across 
1171,,,a stream and this was to the health club remember and they had so 
1172,,,many accidents people twisting their ankles ( ) that they’ve actually 
1173,,,filled in the gaps between them
1174,,Angela,what I don’t want you to do is sort of come back in five years after 
1175,1:15:00,,we’ve done all this and then find that we’ve mucked everything up and 
1176,,,we’ve you know blocked off ( )
1177,,Adrian,well it’s your building you know
1178,,Chris,I think something that looks like a bridge would be well or something 
1179,,,that’s solid would be the unfortunately although I can see the benefit 
1180,,,of having I mean I quite like the idea of stepping stones
1181,,Angela,yes I do I like the idea
1182,,Adrian,well if you like it why don’t we run with it until somebody says you 
1183,,,don’t want to do that
1184,,Angela,you can put we can put like a little verse or something on it so like 
1185,,,you know a verse of
1186,,Chris,don’t fall over
1187,,Angela,yeah do not fall over watch where you’re going
1188,,Peter,step here
1189,,Adrian,I think it’s w n h i l l you can write crownhill on it
1190,,Angela,yes
1191,,Adrian,c r e m a t no you can’t do the crem in crematorium you could 
1192,,,have crownhill written in letters
1193,,Angela,yes that’s 
1194,,Adrian,but obviously there are other routes here 
1195,,Angela,yes that’s
1196,,Adrian,people don’t have to use that there are three ways of getting into that 
1197,,,entrance 
1198,1:16:00,Angela,I was just thinking of like I say what I’m preparing you for is if we do 
1199,,,have a which I’m hoping we’ll have some sort of consultation with 
1200,,,users of this funeral directors and ministers these are the sort of things 
1201,,,that they’ve already highlighted and that they’ll be straight away up 
1202,,,hands straight up and mentioning it so you know we’re just preparing 
1203,,,you for the onslaught of these
1204,,Adrian,can we do that soon because the idea of this meeting is for me to go 
1205,,,away with what I can knowing how to rev up the design to get it into 
1206,,,planning so if we could do that soon that would be great I’d be happy 
1207,,,to present it to them if you wished
1208,,Angela,yes well the other issue I don’t know if you was the erm the 
1209,,,movement of the hearse is they’ve said to get to the wreath caught 
1210,,Adrian,yeah my idea was again similar to the existing building the idea was 
1211,,,there (file) forwards and then back in here because this is all again 
1212,,,under a roof there’s a roof that runs through here
1213,,Angela,[coughs] yep OK
1214,,Adrian,so that’s covered in
1215,,Angela,OK yep
1216,1:17:00,Adrian,and erm the idea was that cars would remain here to pick people up 
1217,,,from the exit
1218,,Angela,yes
1219,,Adrian,the chauffeurs and bearers would have their own little house if you like 
1220,,,here and then they would obviously leave the same way go back round 
1221,,,there
1222,,Angela,well as the majority will have to make a comment about something 
1223,,,and you know they’ll want to be involved in it so that’s that’s fine
1224,,Adrian,the idea is that you can get a couple of limos side by side
1225,,Angela,yes and the hearse doesn’t sort of if it’s going to stay it’ll stay sort of 
1226,,,at the front and that will leave first sometimes they leave and the 
1227,,,limousines are just left as well so that’s fine the wreath court I mean 
1228,,,most of the people like our design of the wreath court whether it needs 
1229,,,to be bigger I’m not sure because flowers now at the moment are huge 
1230,,,and the wreath court we’ve got at the moment isn’t big enough but 
1231,,,again that will perhaps I’m trying to think of where that is in the that 
1232,1:18:00,,what cover the that’s the areas that you called the servant area would 
1233,,,be the end of that then wouldn’t it
1234,,Adrian,yeah this is the last servant area this end has a roof over it and a roof 
1235,,,over that but there’s no roof over the actual planted area here
1236,,Angela,no it’s similar to what we’ve got at the moment 
1237,,Adrian,this is roofed over erm and they’ll be some roofing there of some 
1238,,,kind erm
1239,,Angela,because I think we did ask about roofing all the way round like we’ve 
1240,,,got at the moment
1241,,Adrian,you’ve got that basically I’ll show you the roof plan I’ve + [pulls out 
1242,,,drawing] done a sketch of it here it’s not a finished drawing yet but it 
1243,,,isn’t to be honest my boss has got me working on other things  ++++++ 
1244,,,basically you’ve got the roof there which covers the place where the cars 
1245,,,park  
1246,,Angela,right yes which they haven’t got at the moment
1247,,Adrian,no
1248,,Angela,no no
1249,,Adrian,which the brief did ask for that
1250,,Angela,that’s lovely yes
1251,1:19:00,Adrian,cover that dispersal area this is the planted area around the wreath 
1252,,,court this is the other roof over the back of the wreath court this is the 
1253,,,roof over the chapel and the cremators area the roof (line) running right 
1254,,,through but the cylinder over the catafalque pops its nose through the 
1255,,,roof similarly you get the cylinder from the sanctuary popping its nose 
1256,,,above the roof in that area
1257,,Angela,and this would be open to skylight this would be 
1258,,Adrian,yes this is the central strip here is a roof light arrangement a roof light 
1259,,,is running through here so the roof light idea again would be on the 
1260,,,waiting room it would be over the port cachere it would be over the 
1261,,,centre of the staff room area the staff entrance over the cremators and 
1262,,,over the centre of basically every one of the barrel vaults erm +
1263,,Angela,because I think what they can’t quite see from the drawings obviously 
1264,1:20:00,,the first drawings that we’ve got there is the the fact that some of them 
1265,,,have mentioned the feeling that they get from those sort of what they 
1266,,,think it is some of the comments that have been made about
1267,,Adrian,the aircraft hangar
1268,,Angela,the aircraft hangar or a chicken hut or-
1269,,Adrian,[makes a sound with his lips]
1270,,Angela,I’m just pre-warning you what they might use as a comment so I don’t 
1271,,,want to make you feel you know that’s what they might mention but 
1272,,,they can’t as I’ve said to them 
1273,,Adrian,chicken hut
1274,,Angela,I said what you’re not looking at is the sense of what the roof will be 
1275,,,covered in in a sense how it will look as we drive as you said to me I 
1276,,,said to them what you’ve got to remember is you’re looking at it from 
1277,,,this way you won’t be looking at it when you drive in that way you’ll 
1278,,,be looking at it which is why I’ve done the photographs sorry to point 
1279,,,the photographs of the actual building itself so they could see the actual 
1280,,,sort of you know the feel of how the roof shape is from this angle in a 
1281,,,way so I’ve tried to explain that to them and pre-warn them so they 
1282,,,don’t pick on yer [laughs]
1283,,Adrian,I don’t mind being picked on
1284,,Angela,so + have you met many funeral directors
1285,,Adrian,my shoulders are broad enough
1286,1:21:00,Angela,yes well I was only a size eight when I came and I’m now ( ) so they’re 
1287,,,feeling is in a sense that they obviously like the fact that we’re going to 
1288,,,perhaps involve them and they obviously want to make their own 
1289,,,comments and there’s also inter-fighting between funeral directors one 
1290,,,wants to make another comment over the others and than so you know 
1291,,,it might be sort of mentioned but I think they were quite keen for us to 
1292,,,do something special and I think that it’s nice that we going to perhaps 
1293,,,try and involve them because then they can’t say that they’ve not been 
1294,,,involved and they’ve not had some sort of chance whether they’re 
1295,,,really going to have the same if they say oh we don’t like that I think 
1296,,,whether we take a great deal of that onboard or not is different
1297,,Adrian,well it’s up to us I guess we don’t have to take their comments on 
1298,,,board but if something positive comes out of it we can take it on board 
1299,,Angela,yes I mean don’t forget these also travel to the other crematoriums 
1300,,,sites as well so they might see things that would be you know might 
1301,,,be useful I think we ought to it won’t be difficult for me to arrange a 
1302,,,meeting for them
1303,,Chris,no I think ( )
1304,,Angela,yes yes get that done quite quickly
1305,1:22:00,Adrian,I’d like to talk to you about materials now because working towards 
1306,,,planning drawings we’ll have to describe the materials in detail on the 
1307,,,planning drawings so the planners are clear about what we’re 
1308,,,proposing erm this is  a what we call a section through the building 
1309,,,this is a vertical slice through it showing what it might look like inside 
1310,,,it’s clear what is the served space and the servant space here erm as 
1311,,,you can see the servant space will generally have ducts running through it 
1312,,,for air supply and extraction in this manner through the walls here so this 
1313,,,is where all your servicing will come from and this is where it is 
1314,,,serving the wall to the end of the chapel typically this is the one 
1315,,,looking towards where the hearse would park will have a vertical 
1316,,,slotted glazing in it and then all this area above will be glazed the 
1317,,,walls themselves my initial thought was it will be combination of a 
1318,1:23:00,,couple of types of stone and block work erm I see some use of granite 
1319,,,which might be perhaps a low course around the whole building there 
1320,,,might even be some narrow strips of granite inset within the walls to 
1321,,,give it a sort of patterned effect you might have the odd strip of granite 
1322,,,set in giving you this sort of pattern the rest of the block work would 
1323,,,be a very erm rugged looking block work in contrast to the pristine 
1324,,,smoothness of the concrete frame which would again be exposed OK
1325,,Angela,and this would be the same sort of colour these would the concretes 
1326,,,would match
1327,,Adrian,erm 
1328,,Angela,the roughness and the smooth parts
1329,,Adrian,well yes they could match I don’t think it’s essential that they match in a 
1330,,,way I think I’d like them to be slightly different in shade erm I think that 
1331,,,it would be good to be able to pick the concrete out I’ll show you the 
1332,,,elevations as far as they’ve got at the moment [gets out drawing] these 
1333,1:24:00,,are all the external elevations of the building that show you what it 
1334,,,would look like from the outside these aren’t finished they’re just like 
1335,,,draft lines showing the overall general form at the moment but I need to 
1336,,,go into much much more detail to get these right for example this an 
1337,,,the elevation of the sanctuary this would have slotty window in it so 
1338,,,on and so forth may well have a few other small bits of glass in it 
1339,,,perhaps to get some sort of light flowing through it to make it a very 
1340,,,spiritual space erm this is the end elevation of the chapel so again all 
1341,,,this would be glass through here + OK and I see a lot of this as being 
1342,,,stained glass as well if we can do that
1343,,Angela,some things ( ) we can do that I’m thinking if it’s all glass we have the 
1344,,,self-cleaning glass because obviously it would be nice to make it if 
1345,,,we’re going to have it clear then it needs to be clean so that the light 
1346,1:25:00,,gets in and so the way around not having that is perhaps to do 
1347,,,something with some design or something in there [sound of door 
1348,,,opening and closing] some colour or  something ( ) into it whether not 
1349,,,necessarily even in a sense any sort of recognisable form but a bit like the 
1350,,,church where they’ve got sort of colours or something I don’t know 
1351,,,something perhaps like that rather than making it into a church stained 
1352,,,glass is to make it into a design stained glass if ( ) similar so I have to say 
1353,,,yes
1354,,Adrian,well what I’d like to do is something contemporary perhaps even 
1355,,,cubist or whatever something that is contemporary and architectural 
1356,,,that has lots of colours in it and maybe I could have a go at that having 
1357,,,just taken on board what you’ve said and then have a go at that
1358,,Angela,yes I mean most people when they think of stained glass they think of 
1359,,,sort of gothic patterns or actual church stained glass I mean there are 
1360,,,some people that have got chapels that have dedicated windows so it 
1361,,,might be that we need to leave space for perhaps people to make 
1362,,,donations towards adding bits on to it or something you know leaving a 
1363,1:26:00,,gap that people can add to a sort of (sign) at a later date as well that 
1364,,,you know people might want to contribute I don’t know if there’s 
1365,,,availability for it and we can promote it it might be that we can sort of 
1366,,,do that beforehand even as well
1367,,Chris,even the funeral directors do it
1368,,Angela,well that’s always a poss- you know I should think mr mason will 
1369,,,tell you can get your granite cheaper from this or something from Italy 
1370,,,or something but I mean you know they would be perhaps quite quite 
1371,,,welcoming to make some contribution to that sort of an involvement in 
1372,,,a chapel erm either we decide on a whole scheme and do all of it or 
1373,,,we you know allow people to make a contribution to the chapel and 
1374,,,have some idea of what they would want
1375,,Adrian,yes
1376,,Angela,but it can’t be obviously religious it can’t be sort of too twee because 
1377,,,it just wouldn’t go would it 
1378,,Adrian,it’s not in my
1379,,Angela,no
1380,,Adrian,it’s not in my nature to do that sort of thing
1381,,Angela,I mean it won’t work with a design like this I don’t think so you know 
1382,,,the thought of asking the funeral directors to contribute might mean that 
1383,1:27:00,,they decide they’d like a you know pictures of sort of funeral directors 
1384,,,shape you know that’s what they might spoil it for us if we ask for 
1385,,,their input otherwise we just decide on their behalf and
1386,,Adrian,yes
1387,,Angela,yes so that’s a concern of asking people for their contribution they 
1388,,,want to fix and move it around a bit 
1389,,Adrian,I mean I see it as a spiritual modern art gallery flavour sort of sp-
1390,,Angela,yeah OK
1391,,Adrian,space rather than something religious I’m not a religious person 
1392,,,myself I think religion kills Christianity actually but erm 
1393,,,controversial subject I’m sure
1394,,Angela,don’t get me on religion
1395,,Adrian,but I regard myself as very spiritual ( ) subjected to
1396,,Angela,when you’ve worked here for this long I’ll tell you really yes I’m up 
1397,,,to about here with it really but erm 
1398,,Adrian,I know
1399,,Angela,but erm I mean if you look at the stained glass that we have at the 
1400,,,moment in a sense that although that was nineteen eighty two there is no 
1401,,,particular pattern on the I mean some people have interpreted it as like a 
1402,,,river of some sort of stream of colour running through it but when I spoke 
1403,,,to the man that did the stained glass he just put the colours on the you 
1404,1:28:00,,know and that was he used colours and the shapes because they’re nice 
1405,,,forms and they’re nice shapes of it but there’s no design on it 
1406,,Adrian,no
1407,,Angela,he just put them together but you know people look at it and see what 
1408,,,they want to in it in a sense but I don’t think that it wouldn’t be 
1409,,,something that they would contribute but we need to be fairly strong 
1410,,,that they don’t start to say oh can we also have you know mr mason 
1411,,,senior or someone you know I don’t know once you start asking for 
1412,,,people’s contribution they start mucking it up if you’re not careful in a 
1413,,,way so we’ve got to 
1414,,Adrian,we can ignore these things though
1415,,Angela,yes we can /but it would be nice\
1416,,Adrian,/we’ve got to be\ selective
1417,,Angela,to be able to it might be that they can contribute enough for us to 
1418,,,really do a good job so they might be able to give us enough money that 
1419,,,we can really do something wonderful [everyone talks at once]
1420,,Chris,if they give us the money we’ll come up with a design and you can 
1421,,,come up
1422,,Adrian,well you know it would be wonderful to employ a proper stained glass 
1423,,,artist to contribute something like at robertson college in cambridge 
1424,,,john piper did that did he not do something at coventry cathedral as 
1425,,,well 
1426,,Angela,yeah
1427,1:29:00,Adrian,I mean if we could afford that if someone if you got a lottery winner in 
1428,,,the area who’d like to contribute something
1429,,Angela,well we have done that two brothers wasn’t there yeah two brothers 
1430,,,they’ve got a load of money haven’t they 
1431,,Chris,but yeah I mean the funeral directors some of them might 
1432,,Angela,some of them might be quite willing to  
1433,,Chris,I am continually approached by people who want to nevilles
1434,,Angela,nevilles want to quite willing to contribute money aren’t they
1435,,Chris,masons are (  ) possibly
1436,,Adrian,anyway coming back to materials this is the walk to the vestry and the 
1437,,,office I mean again I see this as being predominantly glazed at 
1438,,,high level [Angela coughs] at low level I was thinking that there might be 
1439,,,some sort of (warm) cladded it might be cedar boarding or something of 
1440,,,that nature or even another hardwood boarding but again glazing above it 
1441,,,of some kind I haven’t worked out how it would be glazed what pattern it 
1442,,,would be but there would be lots of glass essentially so you could get 
1443,1:30:00,,the view out towards the pond the roof I see that as being in a 
1444,,,malleable metal like austenitic stainless steel or lead or copper you’ve 
1445,,,presently got a lead roof here have you not looks like blackened lead
1446,,Angela,plastic
1447,,Adrian,it’s plastic is it
1448,,Angela,swimming pool liner 
1449,,Adrian,is it it looks like lead
1450,,Angela,yes it does it was originally lead the original panels the original 
1451,,,design of the roof was in sections like this and the sections of lead on 
1452,,,these panels and the problem was that they leaked and the water got 
1453,,,underneath through the panels it was used on a building in london and 
1454,,,there was an awful controversy because we’d had it on the roof and 
1455,,,they people oscar schnieder that was there didn’t keep the plans and 
1456,,,there was all sorts of problems do you remember much about that 
1457,,,there was a a lot of
1458,,Chris,no we had to get it replaced
1459,,Angela,completely replaced there was a problem with the original design of 
1460,,,the roof which is the concern some of the funeral directors have got 
1461,,,with ‘design’ in a sense is that this was designed and there were faults 
1462,1:31:00,,with it and you know any design is a fault thing you know waiting to 
1463,,,happen as far they’re concerned because the roof has been mentioned 
1464,,,to me several times by funeral directors and ministers about cor you 
1465,,,know well when this was built there was a lovely roof on it but you got 
1466,,,rid of that because it was leaking and well what a typical waste of 
1467,,,money all that was sort of thing so the roof although isn’t lead is 
1468,,,plastic but it has stains on it and it looks-
1469,,Adrian,looks like lead 
1470,,Angela,yes it looks like lead and it sort of although in some things copper 
1471,,,would be-
1472,,Adrian,copper would be nice yes it would be expensive but we feel the city 
1473,,,has got to invest in this building it’s a very important building and it 
1474,,,has to look nice copper would be lovely and it would go a nice green 
1475,,,colour it would start off a bronzy colour and go green
1476,,Angela,and how would that then I wonder match with the rest of the materials 
1477,,,eventually then I wonder 
1478,,Adrian,I think it would go together beautifully you’d end up with a green roof 
1479,,,in a green environment ++ erm
1480,,Chris,I mean
1481,1:32:00,Adrian,the kimble I think was lead 
1482,,Chris,we’re going to have problems with cost there’s no doubt about it at 
1483,,,some stage we’re at the stage where we’ve just go you know lets press 
1484,,,ahead and get some costings done 
1485,,Angela,yes they’ve got to 
1486,,Chris,once we’re 
1487,,Angela,yes that’s similar to the sections that we had sort of on our roof that 
1488,,,sort of width but they were on plyboards and there was I I can 
1489,,,remember the man coming to speak to me about telling me what was 
1490,,,wrong with it it was all over the place I don’t know whether it was to 
1491,,,do with the fitting of it or-
1492,,Chris,could be the workmanship 
1493,,Angela,yes it wasn’t necessarily the design of the roof itself but it was 
1494,,Adrian,hmm well I think the lead will go beautifully with the concrete 
1495,,,structure 
1496,,Angela,which is what this sort of colour is 
1497,,Adrian,and the pale concrete infill so the whole palette of materials could end 
1498,,,up similar to that 
1499,,Angela,yeah
1500,,Adrian,I mean it it would be nice to+ get some general consensus of opinion 
1501,,,on which way we go I’d be very happy with lead I’d also be happy 
1502,,,with copper or even austenitic stainless steel which will give you a 
1503,,,shinier roof
1504,,Angela,when you say that does that is that shiny then is that
1505,1:33:00,Adrian,you get a shiny silver roof  with the stainless steel maybe that’s a little 
1506,,,bit too ostentatious for such a calm building though that’s perhaps 
1507,,,that’s my third favourite out of the three erm + I think lead would be 
1508,,,lovely but I agree we’d have to get some advice on how to detail it 
1509,,,properly so that /any problems you’ve had in the past would never be 
1510,,,repeated\
1511,,Angela,/yeah I don’t know I mean I can’t I mean we’ve got a file about what 
1512,,,it\ was it might have been not necessarily the actual it was the way it 
1513,,,was fitted on to the roof even I mean it might have been that that was 
1514,,,the problem I don’t know I can’t remember now it was so long ago but 
1515,,,originally and originally it was a ribbed the sections between each 
1516,,,panel had quite a raised rib so some of the old photographs of the roof 
1517,,,here you can quite see it there was a ribbed sort of effect on the roof 
1518,,,itself which you don’t get at the moment particularly
1519,,Adrian,no
1520,,Angela,no 
1521,,Adrian,I mean I’d like to give you that ribbed effect every sort of six hundred
1522,,,millimetres or so you would see some sort of line like that through the 
1523,,,lead you it would be the same in copper because the copper sheet 
1524,,,widths aren’t that wide
1525,1:34:00,Angela,what’s your favourite then lead or copper both
1526,,Adrian,erm I like the lead I think the copper might be lovely I think it might 
1527,,,be even more expensive than lead but I mean if you don’t have a view 
1528,,,on it maybe betty daniels and I can get into a huddle and come back 
1529,,,to you with a proposal
1530,,Angela,you do you could do that one in copper and these two in lead or 
1531,,,something + +
1532,,Adrian,I wouldn’t like to do that I think it should be (controlled)
1533,,Chris,stripes
1534,,Angela,stripes I was just thinking you know 
1535,,Adrian,striped roof
1536,,Angela,striped roof go quicker roof yeah
1537,,Chris,umm
1538,,Angela,OK yeah 
1539,,Adrian,OK so the materials we’ve
1540,,Angela,well go for the most expense go for the best start with Chris and then 
1541,,,we’ll have to compromise won’t we
1542,,Chris,well I mean the query over costs has only just started really believe it 
1543,,,or not 
1544,,Adrian,well I have a [Angela coughs]  ( ) suggestion for you to present to you in 
1545,,,a little while and before I do that I’ve got to run through the ecological 
1546,,,appraisal with you 
1547,,Chris,yeah
1548,,Adrian,erm I don’t know if you’ve had a chance to get a copy to Angela
1549,1:35:00,Chris,Angela’s not had a copy of this
1550,,Adrian,the ecological appraisal basically tells us we’re building a building in 
1551,,,the best part of the site for wildlife whoops but then as Chris also says 
1552,,,in his report the whole site was initially intended as a crematorium 
1553,,,anyway
1554,,Angela,the site has yeah I mean that but then again to be that’s in a sense 
1555,,,the site the wildlife wasn’t here before this crematorium was built the 
1556,,,crematorium has encouraged that wildlife
1557,,Chris,yes
1558,,Angela,in a sense [Adrian pulls out a drawing] so we’ve built that + wildlife up 
1559,,,because of this building and because because of the fact that we haven’t 
1560,,,developed that area because we knew there was talk of other sites and that 
1561,,,so the wildlife pre nineteen eighty two wasn’t even here you know I 
1562,,,doubt if there
1563,,Chris,there was a brick works
1564,,Angela,brick works you know and it wasn’t a development I mean it’s just a 
1565,,,farmers field I would think so the wildlife we’ve encouraged in a sense 
1566,1:36:00,,and so you know I don’t see that we can’t keep that and build it up 
1567,,,even more so I can’t see what the argument is personally as usual 
1568,,,we’ve got newts have we got crested newts
1569,,Chris,no he didn’t find any he thought there might be some
1570,,Adrian,yeah well
1571,,Angela,the last thing we want to do is to decrease the wildlife because people 
1572,,,come here for the pheasants and the muntjac deer and the squirrels 
1573,,,which in your garden you would see as vermin
1574,,Adrian,yeah well on that basis if you don’t want to decrease the wildlife then I 
1575,,,think we’re all singing from the same hymn sheet because Chris has 
1576,,,come up with some mitigation points in there + if we could run through 
1577,,,them I think they’re at the back of the report here somewhere [searches 
1578,,,through report] + + + sorry ( )
1579,,Angela,actually I’ve had a couple of chaps been in to do a from rps has been 
1580,,,in to see he’s coming to his yeah starting at the front + + + 
1581,1:37:00,Adrian,I’ll see if I can find my copy of the report and we can run through it 
1582,,,because Chris er talks about what I call the pier this is our memorial walk 
1583,,,if you like
1584,,Angela,yes
1585,,Adrian,(additional) pond in and the rill one of Chris’ first points was this 
1586,,,is actually barging straight through a nice wildlife area and Chris 
1587,,,suggests that we might consider moving this out the back perhaps to 
1588,,,connect it to this point put it in this direction this piece of land [Angela 
1589,,,coughs] is not of the same wildlife interest as that 
1590,,Chris,hmmm
1591,,Adrian,I think generally he’s trying to encourage me to pull back from 
1592,,,developing over here because this is like your best wildlife area so we 
1593,,,could reduce we could we could reduce our push into the forest here that 
1594,,,might actually have acoustic advantages so you don’t hear the tannoy 
1595,,,from the garage so so maybe the thing to do is to to just look at an area 
1596,,,closer here perhaps move this path a bit further over to maintain some of 
1597,1:38:00,,the forest there but I still like the idea of keeping this there’s an awful lot 
1598,,,of forest here an awful lot of land and I like the idea of the woodland 
1599,,,walk 
1600,,Chris,this is isn’t this the
1601,,Angela,allotments
1602,,Chris,this is allotments 
1603,,Adrian,yeah allotments beyond that line I think 
1604,,Chris,yes
1605,,Adrian,beyond that line
1606,,Chris,yeah
1607,,Adrian,so you know we could reduce this if you like to make it work but what 
1608,,,I was trying to do was to really open up this end of the site to make it 
1609,,,more useful
1610,,Angela,yeah well it it needn’t also there it’s nice ‘cause it balances the 
1611,,,building doesn’t it there’s got to be a certain amount of balance 
1612,,,between the building and the design features otherwise it looks sort of a 
1613,,,bit lost in nothingness around it which is what stevenage has got just 
1614,,,two little bays in front of it really they’ve got this lovely big building 
1615,,,and then they’ve got these two little boxed bays in front of the building 
1616,,,which are awful
1617,,Adrian,yeah what er colin coOK says is [reads  from report] there was valuable 
1618,1:39:00,,areas for wildlife ( ) bramble scrub it says see on plan two + wherever 
1619,,,that is C on plan two
1620,,Angela,yeah OK
1621,,Chris,so that is there [points to drawing]
1622,,Angela,there’s two ( ) which one does he mean this one or that one
1623,,Chris,well it’s the whole area
1624,,Angela,yeah but you see that’s only because somebody hasn’t been down 
1625,,,there to maintain it I mean when I first came in nineteen eighty seven that 
1626,,,grass that was grass that was never scrub that was scrub because of this 
1627,,,the car park here the third car park was mounded up and so that has only 
1628,,,really been there since about eighty nine so you know I mean it’s not 
1629,,,historical it’s just that we’ve done it because we haven’t done any work 
1630,,,on it
1631,,Adrian,it’s only been there about sixteen years
1632,,Angela,and nobody wants to go down there and deal with it I mean there 
1633,,,nothing I don’t think that’s particularly valuable it’s nice 
1634,,Chris,no what he’s saying is it’s developed into a habitat for birds isn’t it 
1635,,,because of the dense (scrub) and invertebrates
1636,,Adrian,so are you saying that all this area the scrub C the adjacent rough 
1637,:40:00,,grassland D and the (relicked) hedgerow A [reads from report] these 
1638,,,currently inaccessible areas will be largely or entirely lost to the proposed 
1639,,,development and effective mitigation is not possible he says well + 
1640,,,particularly intrusive is the formal parterre extending south-east from the 
1641,,,new chapel into the ( ) woodland + a general desira desider excuse me 
1642,,,a general desideratum would be to pull back development from the 
1643,,,south-east boundary he says reducing disturbance of the plantations 
1644,,,and preserving at least some blocks of native vegetation he says there 
1645,,,is some difficulty with the existing scrub vegetation bramble (dogrow)
1646,,,stinging nettles etcetera he says there are first rate wildlife plants but 
1647,,,people unfriendly not least on account of their rapid growth so at the 
1648,,,time what you were saying about it not being (every)
1649,1:41:00,Angela,if you’re going to have my thoughts on that is that even that scrub 
1650,,,needs to be managed better than it is now it’s not managed at all 
1651,,,there’s no management of it and even if you you’re not even managing 
1652,,,that scrub area properly really we’re not managing it and if you were 
1653,,,to actually professionally manage that scrub area I would think 
1654,,,you would have not have it like it is now even I mean it’s not managed 
1655,,,at all you know native plants you’d take the unnative ones out and 
1656,,,you’d clear we don’t have that many brambles so I mean I might be 
1657,,,wrong but I just think that’s that’s a fair point I’m not doubting that but 
1658,,,you know it’s-
1659,,Adrian,yeah  well what Chris says is to to mitigate what he’s just talked 
1660,,,about
1661,,Angela,hmm
1662,,Adrian,either [reads from report] truncate the parterre shorten its length or 
1663,,,reorientate it at ninety degrees to this axis towards the circular pond he 
1664,,,says also we could realign the footpaths away from the site boundary to 
1665,,,leave some large (in habitat) blocks undisturbed so we could pull that 
1666,,,path back (then) move this over as well maybe shorten this
1667,1:42:00,Chris,I think the trouble with that comment is that the only reason that we’re 
1668,,,able to develop this site is if we use it for memorial otherwise we’re 
1669,,,looking at another site entirely
1670,,Angela,yeah
1671,,Chris,because this is a very small site for this size of operation + actually 
1672,,,we’re going to have to maximise use of it for
1673,,Angela,yes
1674,,Chris,erm well not necessarily for modernisation but for scattering aren’t 
1675,,,we
1676,,Angela,yeah
1677,,Chris,now that doesn’t have to mean formal grassland does it
1678,,Angela,no that can be scrub area like it is now but more professionally 
1679,,,managed in a way erm so I mean it’s not to say that we couldn’t allow 
1680,,,a certain amount of brambles and scrub to be left I don’t think that’s a 
1681,,,problem but I mean it’s the fact that obviously he said it’s not people 
1682,,,friendly anyway erm I mean I-
1683,,Chris,/the different\
1684,,Angela,/nobody comes and\ monitors what we’ve got here to start with so I 
1685,,,mean he’s been offered the chance to come and monitor what we’ve got 
1686,1:43:00,,and no-one has ever done that and I mean I don’t quite know I mean 
1687,,,the amount that we’ve got on the boundary that we’ve got here that 
1688,,,they’re not going to be able to use anyway is you know is going to be 
1689,,,difficult to get to use anyway when I mean if this goes all the way I 
1690,,,mean this area here is still going to roughly be intact isn’t it 
1691,,Adrian,yes and what OK what I feel is in order to make sure you get planning 
1692,,,permission we need to be seen to be responding to these comments
1693,,Angela,yeah
1694,,Adrian,so I mean I think we can do that
1695,,Angela,if there’s other areas further into the the very sort of other area that we 
1696,,,can add more to I mean are we we’re adding 
1697,,Adrian,well yes indeed I mean I 
1698,,Angela,/we haven’t done anything with that really have we\
1699,,Adrian,/the plan also yeah I know the plan also shows what\ we’re trying to do 
1700,,,here we’re trying to create an axial wall here that’s on the axis of the 
1701,,,wreath court to a circular pond and again that’s on axis with this odd 
1702,,,construction here and trying to create spaces that might have seating in 
1703,1:44:00,,or whatever and the more woodland walks if you like [Angela coughs] 
1704,,,Chris has gone on in his report to show how the woodland walks might 
1705,,,develop he’s come up with sections showing what planting might be put 
1706,,,along the walks to make sure that they maintain erm + some some 
1707,,,ecological advantages if you like 
1708,,Angela,and to be fair the hedgerow that we’ve already got already down the 
1709,,,pond area we had ermthe existing area above the the yellow bit there the 
1710,,,ancient hedgerow part here there isn’t at the moment anything (a what) 
1711,,,even effecting this that we can’t add sort of more of a wildlife corridor 
1712,,,width to so we could add more to the width on this original hedgerow 
1713,,,here
1714,,Adrian,yes you could amplify this bit and 
1715,,Angela,yeah because that’s only the entrance into the memorial garden from 
1716,,,the other car parks and you wouldn’t necessarily put memorialisation in 
1717,,,that part because you know people walking in don’t necessarily want to 
1718,,,see memorials straight in their faces  
1719,1:45:00,Chris,there’s one issue that we haven’t got to yet which is the transport routes
1720,,Angela,yeah
1721,,Chris,and the (cabinet) member in particular wanted two distinct ways in 
1722,,,from the public to the chapel 
1723,,Angela,yeah
1724,,Adrian,two distinct ways in
1725,,Chris,so yes no well he wanted OK if you’re going to a service in this chapel 
1726,,Adrian,you’d go in this way
1727,,Chris,you’d go there
1728,,Adrian ,yeah
1729,,Chris,right if you go into a service in this chapel he didn’t like the idea that 
1730,,,you drove through here to here  
1731,,Adrian,oh + + + + + why didn’t he like that
1732,,Chris,he thought that there would be people that see that car park 
1733,,,immediately park and go into the wrong service
1734,,Adrian,well we do that with signage
1735,,Angela,yes
1736,,Adrian,I mean frankly I don’t see any other way of doing 
1737,,Chris,but then he was wondering 
1738,,Adrian,but that’s the cortege route
1739,1:46:00,Chris,yes but whether there was a + + + + + possibility of taking vehicles off + 
1740,,Adrian,+ + + erm 
1741,,Chris,and the cortege only continued under the +  + +  I think that’s a bit tight 
1742,,,isn’t it
1743,,Adrian,it is it doesn’t really feel as if that’s what it wants to be 
1744,,Angela,also got the problem with the other traffic + people visiting the memorial 
1745,,,for already existing 
1746,,Chris,yeah well we’re talking about making this a one way system aren’t we  so 
1747,,,that you know that you don’t if you’re visiting the cemetery you have to 
1748,,,come in this anyway so there will be traffic there and then they would 
1749,,,go down
1750,,Adrian,they’d go round this way anti clockwise route at the moment it’s 
1751,,,clockwise I’m saying we’re going to go anti-clockwise in the future
1752,,Chris,yes
1753,,Adrian,and erm we’ll bring the cortege in this way we’ll go through erm  I 
1754,,,discussed this with mkc highways and highways didn’t have a [Angela 
1755,,,coughs] (problem) so if highways didn’t have a problem with it I don’t 
1756,,,see why we have to take on board this (character’s) comments he’s not a 
1757,,,highways engineer + + +
1758,1:47:00,Chris,no it’s just about his concern that people will go into the wrong 
1759,,,chapel because as soon as they came in they’d park up and then
1760,,,wander down to this one and then find out the (wrong place they’re in) 
1761,,,and then walk so yes you’ve got to do it with signage but er signage 
1762,,,becomes a significant issue and how you do that
1763,,Angela,because signage would also be a problem to get them going the second 
1764,,,route wouldn’t it how do you separate them 
1765,,Chris,well
1766,,Angela,when they come in the gate how do they then know which which route 
1767,,,to take even at the start 
1768,,Chris,well if they’re following the cortege they just follow the cortege
1769,,Adrian,yeah you need
1770,,Angela,but most people would arrive early the only time they sort of follow the 
1771,,,cortege is if they at church first and coming for a committal most of the 
1772,,,people arrive before the cortege arrives
1773,,Chris,in which case you’re looking at some
1774,,Angela,/some\
1775,,Chris,almost /some\
1776,,Angela,/some\
1777,,Chris,real-time signs 
1778,,Angela,you’re looking at the name of the person highlighted in if you’re here 
1779,1:48:00,,for mr smith’s funeral go left if you’re here mrs jones’ funeral go 
1780,,,right really aren’t you because they will go they won’t go the way that 
1781,,,they’re even if you put different chapels unless you know they do ask 
1782,,,questions which chapel is it (go in) only one chapel yes but you know 
1783,,,the separation has got to be at the entrance which will obviously effect 
1784,,,the flow of traffic anyway whereas if you’re just bringing them into 
1785,,,one car park they’re sort of quite quickly coming in and you can then 
1786,,,quite quickly route them through the right place in a way even (if 
1787,,,they’ve) parked and come in to see us they then get told which route to 
1788,,,go to maybe I don’t know the concern is that you know they’ve all 
1789,,,got to be queuing up to get in to decide which side of the route they’re 
1790,,,going to take left or right whereas at the moment we’re saying 
1791,,Chris,yeah
1792,,Angela,you’re the wrong route
1793,,Chris,yeah then they’re still going to be queuing milling around here 
1794,,,thinking do I park here
1795,,Angela,yeah
1796,,Chris,do I go on do I park here
1797,,Angela,this is in a sense the issue of the wall
1798,,Chris,have I come in far enough
1799,,Angela,whether we’ve got it attached to the second chapel or you know 
1800,1:49:00,,everyone has the same problems I mean you just have to see how 
1801,,,amersham are dealing with they’ve got one building though you see 
1802,,,that’s a problem we haven’t got we’ve got two buildings and the 
1803,,,problem is we originally thought about trying to take them off the A5 
1804,,,into this chapel didn’t we but that’s not been allowed 
1805,,Adrian,my view is that you the people that are coming to the funeral have to 
1806,,,know whether the funeral is taking place at east chapel or the west 
1807,,,chapel and it can’t be that difficult having signage here that says east 
1808,,,and west chapel car parks this way and you have a sign here that says 
1809,,,west chapel car park straight ahead and you keep having signs up 
1810,,,west chapel car park straight ahead until they get there 
1811,,Chris,mmm
1812,,Adrian,and I don’t see that it can be that difficult really
1813,,Angela,and has this person been to a site similar to this then before or is it just 
1814,,,the thought that there would be this confusion just because they would 
1815,,,feel confused
1816,,Chris,I mean it’s the only issue ( )
1817,,Angela,it is yeah
1818,,Chris,which surprised me because I thought we wasn’t going to 
1819,,Angela,well that’s we’ve thought about that for quite a while haven’t we 
1820,1:50:00,,that’s why in a sense the ideal situation would be to add on a chapel on 
1821,,,to the existing building because you’re still using the same but we’re 
1822,,,not going to do that this is what the issue was with this and the thought 
1823,,,of perhaps trying to get them off the watling street into this one you’d 
1824,,,have a separate entrance completely but that’s not been + + that’s been 
1825,,,sort of taken out I think that’s not been allowed in a sense has it so that if 
1826,,,you’re coming to the east chapel you come in off of the danseed way 
1827,,,if you’re coming from west chapel you come into the watling street 
1828,,,but we’ve that’s not been allowed I think has it because of the amount 
1829,,,of traffic that they think will come in so you know coming up bring 
1830,,,them across and then into these two and a half car parks
1831,,Chris,I mean the car park corridor works well as well because you’re not 
1832,,,taking [Angela coughs] any vast additional space just for car parking are 
1833,,,you you can see it sort of flows there
1834,,Adrian,it’s an extension of the existing system isn’t it I mean this sort of 
1835,,,flowing system set up what we’ve done is- 
1836,1:51:00,Chris,continue it
1837,,Adrian,yes continue it and bring it to and end
1838,,Chris,yeah 
1839,,Adrian,I guess a link through there might help somebody who 
1840,,,accidentally follows the cortege and gets lost then when find 
1841,,,themselves stuck behind the hearse they can just nip in that way
1842,,Chris,yeah
1843,,Adrian,otherwise they’ve got to go all the way around the system and start 
1844,,,again which would be [laughs] a bit funny
1845,,Chris,it would be annoying 
1846,,Adrian,but even then would it be that much of a problem if they’d parked 
1847,,,around here [Angela coughs]  it probably wouldn’t would it they could 
1848,,,park there they could park here and just walk back it wouldn’t be the end 
1849,,,of the world
1850,,Chris,no + there’s putting a small road through there-
1851,,Adrian,I don’t like it it’s messy and Colin Cook wouldn’t like his (  ) 
1852,,,hedge (  ) messed up
1853,,Chris,it’s a signing issue isn’t it really
1854,,Angela,it’s a big signing issue which is 
1855,1:52:00,Chris,big signs here
1856,,Angela,there’s a real issue that we need to I don’t quite know how we’re going 
1857,,,to even even if we did it the other way and have a thing of it it’s still 
1858,,,going to be the issue to get them into the second chapel whatever we 
1859,,,do whichever route we take them through
1860,,Chris,the current sort of discrete signs we’ve got we’re going to have to be 
1861,,Angela,in your face
1862,,Chris,really in your face
1863,,Peter,it’s like the plane terminals isn’t it if you go to terminal one terminal two 
1864,,,terminal three
1865,,Angela,so how do they do that then
1866,,Peter,and you never quite remember which one your flight goes from can 
1867,,,you and then you drive past until you recognise your airline 
1868,,Angela,I’ve never flown I’ve only gone by boat to places I’ve never flown so 
1869,,,I’m a little inexperienced no I’ve never flown I can’t get off the 
1870,,,ground yeah so I mean those sort of places would be interesting to see 
1871,,Peter,well they have a ring road don’t they so that I mean if 
1872,,Angela,you just go back on yourself again 
1873,,Peter,yeah 
1874,,Chris,yes you go round more than once can’t you so if you make a mistake 
1875,,,you  go round again sort of thing
1876,,Adrian,you could get through there and go round again or get in the car park if 
1877,1:53:00,,only the hearse wasn’t in the way
1878,,Chris,well you don’t really want people driving through there
1879,,Adrian,no you don’t 
1880,,Angela,no
1881,,Adrian,so if they get lost they park here and they just walk to wherever they’re 
1882,,,going to go to 
1883,,Angela,I think the wildlife issues I don’t disagree with you can’t add to them 
1884,,,as well 
1885,,Chris,the reason I’m interested was because of this ancient hedge here if 
1886,,,you’re going to drive another road through it
1887,,Adrian,yeah and it goes along the edge I mean there’s a gap there already to 
1888,,,be honest and there’s a ditch there to be honest as well which is the 
1889,,,other + question yeah I mean there’s I can’t remember I’m trying to 
1890,,,think what this was like originally this was just flat so this has only 
1891,,,increased in the last few years so it’s not that we can’t increase it in 
1892,,,other parts you know we can’t add to it with some advice and help
1893,,Chris,so the issue is this do we want this truncated or moved
1894,,Adrian,a bit of both
1895,,Chris,a bit of both
1896,,Adrian,[begins to point at drawing] it would be nice to keep the pond and 
1897,1:54:00,,perhaps up to there and then put the rill perhaps over here erm
1898,,Chris,what do you call this
1899,,Adrian,we call it a rill it’s a very long narrow strip of water that might have 
1900,,,water rushing though it rick fields the landscape architect I 
1901,,,spoke to thought that would have wonderful potential for insects 
1902,,,because insects then to love to follow the water and that would really 
1903,,,amplify the insect garden so what I’d like to do is to perhaps take that 
1904,,,off there and put that down here and build lift that up + + and then this 
1905,,,path could come back and then link to the end of that or link to this
1906,,Chris,mmm
1907,,Adrian,move that over reduce this a bit mitigate the ( )
1908,,Angela,I don’t know could we not add sort of things around the paths I mean 
1909,,,would that help at all by adding more sort shrubs and trees 
1910,,Adrian,that’s what erm Chris is suggesting in this report
1911,,Angela,oh was he saying that you’ve got to move the paths back and (also 
1912,1:55:00,,increases) is that what he’s saying or not just +
1913,,Adrian,well what he’s saying is he’s offered a number of alternatives in here 
1914,,,he’s saying er well he’s offering options about what we could do with 
1915,,,the paths and + I think it would be really good if Angela could have a 
1916,,,copy to read
1917,,Chris,hmm
1918,,Adrian,and [reads report] + + +
1919,,Angela,I mean these are some of these trees in this area no over there erm I 
1920,,,think he’s been here before and said there’s not a great deal of quality 
1921,,,trees in there in a sense they’ve obviously just sort of self-seeded and 
1922,,,been left in there and so you know we can add more wildlife friendly 
1923,,,trees into that area as well there are a couple of oak trees over on this 
1924,,,side as well sort of just a bit down though that I think we talked about 
1925,,,like the one at selbourne you know the
1926,,Chris,mmm 
1927,1:56:00,Angela,yes one or two sort of quite nice oak trees that are quite big probably 
1928,,,been there for a few years now and so it would be nice to keep those as 
1929,,,well so I mean that’s I mean that’s I’m trying to think where 
1930,,Adrian,I must admit I kind of saw my site boundary as being sort of inside 
1931,,,here [points] but if you think that by saying that we’d we’d allow the 
1932,,,landscape architect to go further and develop this area that would be
1933,,Angela,well I mean we’re going to need the area for some sort of memorial 
1934,,,scheme as such and if you know this area hasn’t really got a great deal 
1935,,,of development potential at the moment we need to add to that these 
1936,,,trees are really I don’t they’re only sort of willows which are nice and 
1937,,,they have some wildlife but they’re they’ve you know we’ve not 
1938,,,concentrated on developing this area for memorialisation
1939,,Adrian,no it looks like a brickworks still doesn’t it 
1940,,Angela,yes it does and some of the roads are quite poor quality but this would 
1941,,,be sort of like the oak one of the oak trees sort of like here and I mean 
1942,,,all this boundary was planted when this was built so I mean it’s not that
1943,1:57:00,,ancient as far as I’m aware the only ancient bit is this bit here that 
1944,,,comes along here which is the old hedgerow 
1945,,Adrian,yeah
1946,,Angela,this has all been put in since this was developed this isn’t ours 
1947,,,obviously this front bit that’s parks trust 
1948,,Chris,mmm
1949,,Angela,that front bit
1950,,Chris,that’s where those newt ponds are 
1951,,Angela,yeah so they’ve done some work on there the parks trust but that’s not 
1952,,,ours that’s our boundary in a sense and that’s all parks trust from this
1953,,Chris,yeah so this whole strip here is now headstones isn’t it
1954,,Angela,yes that’s our willow section
1955,,Adrian,and this bit
1956,,Angela,we haven’t developed it because of the fact it’s number one it’s very 
1957,,,wet and number two is that the development is difficult to plan you 
1958,,,know you’re looking at a big scheme in a way as to sort of how to deal 
1959,,,with it whether you keep existing roads and 
1960,,Adrian,certainly we could look at bringing that into the scheme and erm 
1961,,,which would make sense because you’ve got a nice area here it 
1962,,,would be nice to do something with that as well
1963,1:58:00,Angela,so the pond here as well and we’ll see that the pond at the very far 
1964,,,corner there’s a pond at the far corner so would I mean does that I 
1965,,,don’t know whether that has any effect on the fact of trying to sort of 
1966,,,incorporate that into some design or something has he said anything 
1967,,,about the pond in here 
1968,,Adrian,what the circular pond 
1969,,Chris,no the 
1970,,Angela,big pond 
1971,,Adrian,this pond you mean
1972,,Angela,yes has he mentioned that
1973,,Adrian,yeah he does mention it somewhere in the report 
1974,,Chris,( )
1975,,Angela,but it’s obviously water appears from somewhere to come into there 
1976,,,yes so it’s quite a wet site that indicates as to
1977,,Chris,there’s a ditch down here isn’t there somewhere
1978,,Angela,yes
1979,,Adrian,yeah
1980,,Angela,yes but it doesn’t go in the ditch it’s just 
1981,,Chris,no it’s pretty dry
1982,,Adrian,I think what I’m looking for is a direction from yourselves on how 
1983,,,seriously I need to take the report my own feeling is that I would like 
1984,,,to take it as seriously as I possibly could to make sure I can get 
1985,,,planning permission but I think you’re tempering that by the reality of 
1986,,,[Angela coughs] having a business to run basically where you need as 
1987,1:59:00,,much space as possible externally for it to have the right atmosphere 
1988,,Chris,I mean I don’t think (they’ll write this) I mean the idea of forest walks 
1989,,,is
1990,,Angela,is what we wanted
1991,,Chris,is what we wanted because that’s what it’s designed to do the whole 
1992,,,site is a woodland cemetery really and this site this area here’s still 
1993,,,really although its on to the houses you know we haven’t developed 
1994,,,this sort of site really I mean that’s not been developed at all but I 
1995,,,mean we you know there’s nothing to say that we can’t add to it you 
1996,,,know
1997,,Adrian,I think what we’re saying is that the idea behind cutting that short
1998,,Angela,that would be a yeah that would be ( ) too much yeah and putting it 
1999,,,over there
2000,,Chris,the other thing we  haven’t talked about is book or remembrance is it
2001,,Angela,we have a book of remembrance
2002,,Chris,we have a second book of remembrance + + + + +
2003,,Angela,I don’t know possibly because we haven’t got an office particularly 
2004,2:00:00,,here for a I mean we’ve only got a sort of an interviewing area I mean 
2005,,,there’s nothing the book of remembrance for in here the top has the 
2006,,,potential that we could extend it slightly out on to that top lawn if we 
2007,,,needed to I suppose if we’re not going to put another chapel on it
2008,,Chris,yeah
2009,,Angela,so it might be 
2010,,Chris,but you what I’m thinking is will it be that allegiance is transferred so 
2011,,,that once they’ve been cremated here they want to come down here for 
2012,,,the book of remembrance in the chapel rather than that one 
2013,,Angela,yeah
2014,,Adrian,[shuffles papers] but it wouldn’t be difficult to incorporate a little room on 
2015,,,the + + [noise of Peter moving chairs] if we’re widening [begins to 
2016,,,sketch] this say and putting perhaps a (really) in or something and maybe 
2017,,,a couple of memorial walls or something so forth it wouldn’t be difficult 
2018,,,to create a little remembrance room as an individual object somewhere on 
2019,2:01:00,,the parterre ( ) would be getting something
2020,,Angela,like a dovecote sort of you know something more lively or something 
2021,,,not quite 
2022,,Adrian,you might get something like this happening where you know 
2023,,Angela,thatched
2024,,Adrian,this walk does something like that + little walk through there which 
2025,,,links up with that one and then we’re pulling back from that side and 
2026,,,the garden is becoming more in this direction than over here 
2027,,Chris,mmm
2028,,Angela,mmm + + +
2029,,Chris,I think stick with that don’t you
2030,,Angela,I think so yes
2031,,Chris,I mean if you want to do that (something later stage) 
2032,,Angela,that would be the next whatever it would be perhaps nicer to the 
2033,,,money that we would spend developing that side to develop over here 
2034,,,really yeah I’m also sl- slightly anxious about the effect it that all this 
2035,,,will have on the people tending those plots really the graves because 
2036,,,of the the feeling that they have here at the moment it’s difficult to say 
2037,,,in two thousand and nine perhaps when we start to do it things might be 
2038,2:02:00,,changed for them anyway but it’s the it would be nice to sort of perhaps 
2039,,,incorp- not leave this gap which you’ve got here at the moment isn’t there 
2040,,,there’s a sort of structure with the headstones then there’s a gap then 
2041,,,there’s all this new development going on here it would be nice to sort of 
2042,,,try and phase some of that into over on this side as well sort of bring it in 
2043,,,to that part would be quite nice I like the rills I like rills I think of that 
2044,,,place in was it in Spain
2045,,Adrian,oh granada
2046,,Peter,the alhambra
2047,,Angela,yes
2048,,Adrian,the alhambra (the relief there) oh fantastic
2049,,Angela,so if we can go for that that’ll be fine OK I mean the rills and really 
2050,,,because water is so precious isn’t it it’s to show your wealth that you 
2051,,,can have just a garden with water in because you know water’s 
2052,,,nothing to you you’ve got this wonderful wealth that you don’t need to 
2053,,,worry about it that’s that is nice but the rill and the walls memorial 
2054,,,walls [makes sound of cash register: all laugh]
2055,,Adrian,good well I think I know where I’m going now in terms of mitigation 
2056,2:03:00,,but again it would help me Angela if you would like to read that and if 
2057,,,you’d like to email me any comments or-
2058,,Angela,yes I’m very keen to keep the wild I mean the wildlife is probably my 
2059,,,fault because I’ve probably encouraged it by putting stuff out for the 
2060,,,foxes down there [laughs] and you know in a sense it’s going to be very 
2061,,,difficult for them to survive and wildlife survival when we develop over 
2062,,,on to the other side a development on to this side I mean at the moment 
2063,,,we’re on the edge of the rough area from here to calverton there’s not a 
2064,,,great deal between us and calverton and once they start to develop over 
2065,,,on that side then it’s you know the wildlife probably wouldn’t survive 
2066,,,very well anyway for us coz they obviously have access at the 
2067,,,moment to the green field sites opposite really and you know 
2068,,,concentrating them all here would be you know there’d be in fighting 
2069,,,and all sorts of things I should think and milton keynes has got a I 
2070,,,mean we’re not saying we wouldn’t increase it I did talk about to 
2071,,Chris ,about having a wildlife hut you know a a a bird um
2072,2:04:00,Adrian,hide
2073,,Angela,hide
2074,,Adrian,well funnily enough in there in the report there’s all sorts of other 
2075,,,mitigation recommendations that we could implement and I’d be very 
2076,,,keen to do that erm he’s recommended birds bird nest boxes bat 
2077,,,roosting boxes
2078,,Angela,yes
2079,,Adrian,bird feeding areas with a hide or viewing screen an insect garden for 
2080,,,butterflies and bees a sensory garden for those especially older visitors 
2081,,,who may be visually impaired which I think is lovely fruit trees again 
2082,,,it says some maintenance is required for fruit production but birds and 
2083,,,mammals would benefit from it
2084,,Angela,mmm
2085,,Adrian,and fruiting or seed-bearing plants for birds pond or bird baths well 
2086,,,we’ve got ponds you know it can be heavy on maintenance [Angela 
2087,,,coughs] and he’s talking about sculpture and natural materials well you 
2088,,,could think about that that would be nice
2089,,Angela,I mean there’s nothing to say in the book of remembrance couldn’t 
2090,,,incorporate a bird hide as well you could have a book of remembrance 
2091,2:05:00,,with a bird hide at the back of it as well
2092,,Adrian,whether they’d that would be in the right place I mean a bird hide 
2093,,,might be better located sort of somewhere over here rather than your 
2094,,,main parterre but he’s talking about information panels on the wildlife 
2095,,Angela,yes well perhaps you could give me some because I’ve asked him for 
2096,,,that already and I’m still waiting two years down the line for that
2097,,Adrian,yeah
2098,,Angela,he’s a very busy man Chris isn’t he I mean it is one thing to
2099,,Adrian,so so I’d really like your combined response to all these proposals of 
2100,,,mitigation because I’m quite happy to implement the lot and I I’d 
2101,,,really like to get your steer on it
2102,,Chris,well I mean as Angela says I mean we have been pushing for this 
2103,,Adrian,have you
2104,,Angela,yeah I’ve been asking for the bird my idea was originally for a bird 
2105,,,hide about four years ago
2106,,Adrian,oh right
2107,,Angela,from well would have been [looks at scheme] oh I can’t show you on 
2108,,,this without overlooking the seed part here for the bird hide he said 
2109,,,you can’t put a bird hide I said it won’t matter you know it would be 
2110,2:06:00,,lovely to sit here and look at all the birds here as I do and that you 
2111,,,know quite often if you creep up there on that bank you’ll see the fox 
2112,,,curled up so I mean I’m just as concerned about the development on 
2113,,,what I see as my garden my wildlife garden as he is in a way at the 
2114,,,same time I don’t think that we can’t resolve some of these things 
2115,,,because these are only this is only within our own making we’ve only 
2116,,,done this ourselves over the last sort of since at least eighty eight eighty 
2117,,,nine through laziness really I mean this used to be completely ploughed 
2118,,,through and nothing was done so you know what we’ve achieved in a few 
2119,,,years we could again do it that same here I’m not I’m quite happy to 
2120,,,implement all these
2121,,Adrian,lovely well that’s that’s very helpful
2122,,Angela,and people
2123,,Adrian,very encouraging
2124,,Angela,people that come to our grounds see it that that as a garden of eden 
2125,,,like I said you wouldn’t particularly want squirrels in your garden 
2126,,,particularly because you know they’re vermin and they’re not natural I 
2127,,,mean you’d like red squirrels but we haven’t got those we’re not 
2128,,,cardiff no erm carlisle crematorium where they’ve got red squirrels in 
2129,,,their grounds erm but we’ve got grey squirrels we’ve got muntjac deer 
2130,2:07:00,,that eat the roses and that cause vandalism if you had them in your 
2131,,,garden you would probably want to shoot them so people that come 
2132,,,here see it as being an area that is in a sense for them like a garden of 
2133,,,eden you wouldn’t do it because it means that there that it shows 
2134,,,there’s an area that cares and doesn’t worry about that it’s an area of 
2135,,,sort of spirituality heaven you know that sort of thing as they (think) 
2136,,,it so what we allow here is all the vermin that nobody else wants really 
2137,,,and people like that so we don’t discourage it and in a sense I’d like to 
2138,,,add more to it but we have a limited need to put this on the site and to 
2139,,,make sure it’s done properly and that takes up a lot of space doesn’t it 
2140,,,erm you know but we’ve got to do it erm
2141,,Chris,in doing it we’re trying to do it sympathetically aren’t we
2142,,Angela,yeah
2143,,Chris,so the idea that these car parks surrounded by woods 
2144,,Angela,yeah
2145,,Chris,it’s not just a bog standard square car park with a few trees it’s erm-
2146,,Angela,it’s some sort of you know adding to it but all this isn’t something that 
2147,1:08:00,,we haven’t already decided on I mean some of these things of 
2148,,,sculpture information I’ve asked them for years for information panels 
2149,,,but it’s like banging your head against the wall it’s like asking them to 
2150,,,sub give me some information for my webpage for wildlife that we’ve 
2151,,,got in here + + so you know this isn’t something that we haven’t 
2152,,,discussed already to be honest with
2153,,Adrian,excellent well lets implement the lot then lets do it great well that’s 
2154,,,really really helpful next item on the agenda is costs what do you 
2155,,,think it’s going to cost then Chris [all laugh]
2156,,Angela,I think I think between eight and twelve million +
2157,,Adrian,lower
2158,,Angela,oh is it oh what present day price then so six million 
2159,,Adrian,well lower than that
2160,,Angela,four
2161,,Adrian,well you’re getting warmer now getting warmer still lower than that
2162,,Chris,for the whole
2163,,Adrian,for the whole shooting match including landscaping but excluding 
2164,1:09:00,,vat and excluding all fees our quantity surveyor says you can have 
2165,,,the building and the landscaping soft landscaping hard landscaping 
2166,,,three point six five million all in
2167,,Chris,well done then
2168,,Angela,well that’s it where do we sign
2169,,Chris,does that include the cremators
2170,,Adrian,includes the cremators
2171,,Chris,including the cremators
2172,,Adrian,the cremators are only five hundred and eighty odd thousand pounds all 
2173,,,in + + +
2174,,Angela,with the mercury filtration are they
2175,,Adrian,yup
2176,,Chris,that’s cheaper than buying them in
2177,,Angela,yes I think there was some discussion there was something they said 
2178,,,about that wasn’t there I think the man from facultatieve had said 
2179,,,something about that I think coz we’re getting two machines wasn’t 
2180,,,it if we’d got one machine it would have been more I can’t remember 
2181,,,there was something discussed about that 
2182,,Adrian,yeah /it was\
2183,,Angela,/there was something\ wasn’t there
2184,,Adrian,much more economical to buy
2185,,Angela,/or could get two machines\
2186,,Adrian,/two machines\ than the one now I’ve discussed with facultatieve all 
2187,,,the the options that they listed at the end of their quotation and erm
2188,1:10:00,,they’ve put all sorts of options in basically you’d need to take on board 
2189,,,all of them in his opinion the options include and extra large cremator
2190,,,for 
2191,,Angela,for /bigger\ 
2192,,Adrian,/folks\ 
2193,,Angela,people
2194,,Adrian,my size
2195,,Angela,and ladies my size too I’m building up to getting stuck in the cremator 
2196,,,doors that’s what I’m building up to [all laugh]
2197,,Angela,they won’t forget me when they cremate me that’s what I’m looking 
2198,,,for yes
2199,,Adrian,and that’ll cost you another seven and a quarter thousand pounds 
2200,,Angela,ok
2201,,Adrian,automatic soot blowing apparently is is very important because it will 
2202,,,increase the lifespan of your cremators it’s very important for the 
2203,,,maintenance but that’s twenty-five thousand
2204,,Angela,soot ( )
2205,,Adrian,automatic cremulator and remains transfer cabinet well that’s sixteen 
2206,,,thousand pounds they recommend it but you have some concerns about 
2207,,,[Angela coughs] whether it’s really needed 
2208,,Angela,well yes I mean that’s as they develop and things change I mean 
2209,,,that’s a possibility 
2210,,Adrian,ok
2211,,Angela,yep
2212,1:11:00,Adrian,and the last one is a coffin and table charger this is all to do with 
2213,,,health and safety of people pushing heavy coffins into the cremator er 
2214,,,that’s fifteen thousand pounds but that’s an automatic device to sort of 
2215,,,pull a lever and then the coffin pushed in to the cremator
2216,,Chris,hmm
2217,,Adrian,it’s recommended that you go for all those options so that brings the 
2218,,,cost up from five hundred and twenty five to about five hundred and 
2219,,,eighty as I recall
2220,,Angela,(a boiler) a gas flue gas oh right OK  yes flue gas boiler sonic blast 
2221,,,cleaning boiler tubes + + + + +
2222,,Chris,(information) to see that’s twin boilers (where it is) 
2223,,Angela,well would it would you only have one boiler between (sets)
2224,,Chris,oh you’ve only got one boiler haven’t you yes that’s right we’re 
2225,,,talking about the flue treatment
2226,,Angela,flue treatment yep
2227,2:12:00,Chris,flue treatment boiler not the major ( ) + + +
2228,,Angela,not too sure about that
2229,,Chris,no
2230,,Angela,but it might be that they they have to do some additions and changes
2231,,,and if they say well you can have those machines and the ft2s I mean 
2232,,,why the so that’s + FT3s and ft2s 
2233,,Chris,one thing I did notice when we were looking at the plans 
2234,,,where the cremators are going is the lack of space at the ash end
2235,,Adrian,[pulls out a drawing] erm I thought facultatieve were happy with that I 
2236,,,worked it up with them 
2237,,Chris,if you look at the current one see the space in front what you’ve got is 
2238,,Angela,for /raking out\
2239,,Chris,/raking out\ 
2240,,Adrian,yeah I think
2241,,Chris,you’ve got a big long handled pole
2242,,Adrian,yeah the idea is that you’ve got all this space here to to sort of do that 
2243,,,operation 
2244,,Angela,what are those two items there (I can’t see them)
2245,,Adrian,this is the bag filter and this is the boiler
2246,2:13:00,Angela,well are they on the roof or are they in the room
2247,,Adrian,they are in the room I think somewhere I’ve got a copy of their 
2248,,,drawing [searches for drawing] (I intended to bring it) + where they set 
2249,,,out where they put them
2250,,Angela,oh this was the mercury filtration things wasn’t it yeah
2251,,Adrian,(this might be it) I had intended to bring a copy of their drawings I beg 
2252,,,your pardon if I didn’t I haven’t got it
2253,,Chris,[looking at sample of stone] are these ( ) is this a facing material
2254,,Adrian,no that’s just a thin slice of the face of the block the actual block itself 
2255,,,would be about hundred to a hundred and twenty five wide on the outer 
2256,,,leaf
2257,,Chris,right
2258,,Adrian,and this particular this is actually bonded to a standard block so you 
2259,,,pay for that much [points] granite but it’s built as part of a block that 
2260,,,that’s wide 
2261,,Angela,that’s the centre that would the seating areas round so they’re blocks
2262,,Chris,no no they’re hang hung on
2263,,Angela,hung on
2264,,Adrian,hung on ( ) 
2265,,Angela,oh right yeah
2266,2:14:00,Adrian,but this comes probably cement bonded to the actual block this I’d like 
2267,,,to use in quite thin bands I think but I think it adds a touch of class if 
2268,,,you like to that basic 
2269,,Chris,hmm
2270,,Adrian,block
2271,,Angela,I just we haven’t never had it and I hope we never do but things like 
2272,,,graffiti and things like that you know (strike through) being a 
2273,,,possibility if we start having (services) you shouldn’t have a problem 
2274,,,really and concrete of course concrete’s not very environmentally 
2275,,,friendly is it I suppose do we they say they moan about that on the 
2276,,,house building show you have to plant things in the building as sort of 
2277,,,there we are I mean I quite like the I like I mean would it be rough 
2278,,,like this parts of it would be rough
2279,,Adrian,I think the whole /idea\
2280,,Angela,/coarse\
2281,,Adrian,is that this is all quite coarse surface and you contrast the coarseness of 
2282,,,the wall with the smoothness of the concrete 
2283,,Angela,yeah
2284,,Adrian,and the smoothness of the granite 
2285,,Angela,hmm yeah
2286,,Adrian,erm I thought that was quite a nice contrast 
2287,,Angela,well I quite like the quartziness in that as well quite nice
2288,,Chris,yeah
2289,,Angela,perhaps we yeah
2290,2:15:00,Chris,how big are these
2291,,Adrian,the blocks themselves would be erm four hundred and forty millimetres 
2292,,,long by two hundred and fifty millimetres high but if they could be 
2293,,,lowered they might be only a hundred and forty [Angela coughs]
2294,,Chris,yeah 
2295,,Adrian,erm I haven’t made those precise decisions yet 
2296,,Chris,no no + no no
2297,,Adrian,that’s the sort of size that we’d be getting 
2298,,Chris,yeah OK and this is for external and internal or
2299,,Adrian,erm that’s primarily for external for internal I haven’t quite made up 
2300,,,my mind [searches for papers] internal I might want a plain white block 
2301,,,there was another block somewhere I brought which I was considering for 
2302,,,internal use not entirely convinced about it it was something like that 
2303,,,[shows sample] again that would come bonded to a block but (far I’m 
2304,,,carried on) [laughs] that one actually just a simple white block is all we 
2305,,,need internally which would like more like the back of that 
2306,,Angela,( ) what’s the yeah what’s is it like that both sides 
2307,,Adrian,this is a silver-grey brushed block +
2308,2:16:00,Angela,see that’s a different + it’s the other reverse isn’t it 
2309,,Chris,that’s the back + +
2310,,Angela,hmmm and that’s concrete as well 
2311,,Adrian,yeah + but that’s how I see the interior as a smooth block face so it 
2312,,,might be smooth internally and /course externally\
2313,,Angela,/I quite like that\
2314,,Chris,yeah that is nice
2315,,Angela,compared to that 
2316,,Chris,I don’t like that
2317,,Angela,not particularly 
2318,,Adrian,no lets put that one away [laughs] (I don’t like it myself)  
2319,,Angela,I quite like that that although it’s obviously the reverse of it I know 
2320,,,it’s the reverse but that’s I quite like that with the the erm that bits 
2321,,,the bigger bits in it I mean + chunks I don’t know what you’d call them 
2322,,Adrian,aggregate 
2323,,Chris,yeah
2324,,Adrian,the aggregate’s inside it 
2325,,Angela,and would the granite also have the silvery this pearlious effect as 
2326,,,well would that (be)
2327,,Adrian,it would be just like that I mean it
2328,,Angela,I mean /this is like a bluebell\
2329,,Adrian,/depending on what these things\
2330,,Angela,headstone this is what yeah which is a you can get a bluey colour 
2331,2:17:00,,with this sort of silver flecking in which is obviously a + yeah + so I’ve 
2332,,,got some interest but I mean the funeral directors will have a some of 
2333,,,them will have a big interest in the granite type you wait that’ll be the 
2334,,,big ‘cause that’s their knowledge I mean they know quite a lot about 
2335,,,granites and + yeah
2336,,Adrian,we’ll be going to this company lignacite four and they (  ) lignacite 
2337,,,where they /source their granite from\
2338,,Angela,/source their + China I bet\
2339,,Adrian,they wouldn’t have a say in it if you specify lignacite block with a 
2340,,,granite face 
2341,,Chris,they wouldn’t tell you where they /got it from\
2342,,Angela,/probably got it from China\
