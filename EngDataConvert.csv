Being that we shouldn't criticize ideas of other people or even your own ideas,or you shouldn't think. I know that's not gonna work because XY and Z at this moment in time we're just getting out all the different ideas,all the different avenues, and whether they work or not is something that will sit through later when we try and find the good ones.Basically what you should do instead.Rather, if you start to go down,reducing illness, not going to work,trying to make yourself think well how,how can I change it so it does work?How can I use it as a springboard to do something else?Don't interrupt other people will try not to unless they talk for too long or visiting.I'll keep an eye on that anyway.That's predictable.
