1,1,0:02:53,AJ,weeee  we've all had a one pager sent by Robert with some information ,weeee one pager sent robert information,robert pager information
2,2,0:03:00,AJ,about the project what we're trying to achieve I'm just going to ,project trying achieve going,achieve project going
4,4,0:03:00,AJ,brainstorms before others haven't perhaps or certainly not in my ,brainstorm others perhaps certainly,brainstorm certainly others
5,5,0:03:00,AJ,brainstorms and so one thing that's important about all this during right at ,brainstorm one thing important right,thing brainstorm important
6,6,0:04:00,AJ,the start is some of the rules that we'd like to have adhered to within ,start rule adhered within,adhered rule start
7,7,0:04:00,AJ,brainstorms the most important one really is being that we shouldn't ,brainstorm important one really,brainstorm important one
8,8,0:04:00,AJ,criticise ideas of other people or even your own ideas or you shouldn't ,criticise idea people even idea,idea criticise people
9,9,0:04:00,AJ,think oh no that's not going to work because x y and z at this moment in ,going work moment,moment work going
10,10,0:04:00,AJ,time we're just getting out all the different ideas all the different avenues ,time getting different idea different avenue,idea time avenue
11,11,0:04:00,AJ,and whether they work or not is something that we'll sift through later er ,whether work something sift later er,sift er work
12,12,0:04:00,AJ,when we try and find a good one      basically what you should do instead ,find good one basically instead,good basically find
13,13,0:04:00,AJ,rather if you start going down the route of thinking oh that's not going to ,rather start going route thinking going,start route thinking
14,14,0:04:00,AJ,work try to make yourself think well how can I change it so it does work ,work make well change doe work,work change doe
15,15,0:04:00,AJ,how can I use it as a springboard to do something else don't interrupt ,use springboard something else interrupt,springboard interrupt something
16,16,0:04:00,AJ,other people or try not to unless they talk for too long obviously I’ll ,people unless talk long obviously,talk people long
17,17,0:04:00,AJ,keep an eye on that anyway,keep eye anyway,eye anyway keep
0,18,0:04:00,Tony,so can I interrupt you anyway     ,interrupt anyway,interrupt anyway
20,20,0:05:00,AJ,I knew someone would say that it's a bit predictable Tony,knew someone would say bit predictable tony,bit tony predictable
1,22,0:05:00,Tony,I’ve sort of looked through the briefing stuff first as well it will make it ,sort looked briefing stuff first well make,sort make stuff
2,23,0:05:00,Tony,hard for them to transcribe what's going on as well if we're all talking at ,hard transcribe going well talking,transcribe talking hard
3,26,0:05:00,Tony,so we should try and be a bit more disciplined with that,bit disciplined,bit disciplined
27,27,0:05:00,AJ,that's right unless there’s something of value of course and then we ,right unless something value course,unless something course
28,28,0:05:00,AJ,suddenly all talk so loud in theory      erm,suddenly talk loud theory erm,talk suddenly erm
30,30,0:05:00,AJ,erm so don't interrupt is a good idea try to explain your ideas but ,erm interrupt good idea explain idea,idea good erm
31,31,0:05:00,AJ,don't go on forever obviously try to break existing mindsets so you've ,go forever obviously break existing mindset,mindset forever break
32,32,0:05:00,AJ,seen some of the sketches or you've seen a sketch on the briefing ,seen sketch seen sketch briefing,sketch briefing seen
33,33,0:05:00,AJ,document some of you have been closer involved in the project have seen ,document closer involved project seen,project involved closer
34,34,0:05:00,AJ,quite a lot of sketches and a form factor has already taken shape quite a lot ,quite lot sketch form factor ha already taken shape quite lot,lot factor form
35,35,0:05:00,AJ,on some of those sketches but I would suggest that we try to park that at ,sketch would suggest park,park sketch suggest
36,36,0:05:00,AJ,the back of our mind and because actually there may be completely ,back mind actually may completely,completely mind back
37,37,0:05:00,AJ,different form factors that maybe quite relevant as well errm childli  ,different form factor maybe quite relevant well errm childli,relevant form childli
38,38,0:05:00,AJ,childlike behaviour er is fine but don't draw on the table because Gerald ,childlike behaviour er fine draw table gerald,fine er gerald
39,39,0:06:00,AJ,will get angry and an  everything is possible at this stage so due to the ,get angry everything possible stage due,stage angry due
40,40,0:06:00,AJ,brainstorm then we should concentrate on divergence of ideas not on ,brainstorm concentrate divergence idea,brainstorm concentrate divergence
41,41,0:06:00,AJ,convergence so we try to generate as many ideas and as many different ,convergence generate many idea many different,idea generate convergence
42,42,0:06:00,AJ,avenues as we possibly can      what's quite important is its about ,avenue possibly quite important,avenue important possibly
43,43,0:06:00,AJ,the thermal incli  inclis      pen but its also about the media so its the ,thermal incli inclis pen also medium,pen inclis thermal
44,44,0:06:00,AJ,interaction between the special paper and the thermal pen basically ok? ,interaction special paper thermal pen basically ok,pen paper special
45,45,0:06:00,AJ,but I know quite a lot of the briefing openly focuses about the print and ,know quite lot briefing openly focus print,openly lot print
46,46,0:06:00,AJ,things like that and obviously that's a key aspect of the brainstorm but we ,thing obviously key aspect brainstorm,key aspect brainstorm
47,47,0:06:00,AJ,should also not forget that the paper is involved in all of this as well      ,also forget paper involved well,paper involved forget
48,48,0:06:00,AJ,so you'll have seen some of those pictures and I don't know Jeremy do ,seen picture know jeremy,jeremy picture know
49,49,0:06:00,AJ,you want to give a – do you want to say a couple of words about the sort ,want give want say couple word sort,sort word couple
0,51,0:06:00,Jamie,err  yeah I think the one on the top left is the one that's the real main ,err one top left one real main,real main err
1,52,0:08:00,Jamie,focus of the of  what we're doing today,focus today,focus today
2,54,0:08:00,Jamie,that's the standard plain thermal paper and then it can draw its either ,standard plain thermal paper draw either,standard paper draw
3,55,0:08:00,Jamie,atoms or line types er so for the process of making this prototype that's ,atom line type er process making prototype,process making prototype
4,56,0:08:00,Jamie,going to help us sell the project that's the concept really design a a ,going help u sell project concept really design,project sell concept
5,57,0:08:00,Jamie,prototype umm the other ideas on the paper there were other concepts for ,prototype umm idea paper concept,prototype paper concept
6,58,0:08:00,Jamie,a thermal pen which may form the ultimate product but are not what ,thermal pen may form ultimate product,thermal pen form
7,59,0:08:00,Jamie,we're going to prototype first,going prototype first,prototype first going
8,61,0:08:00,Jamie,erm so we may want to talk about those later as a sort of broader ,erm may want talk later sort broader,broader sort talk
9,63,0:08:00,Jamie,spectrum but the main focus is that style pen where you'll create a set of ,spectrum main focus style pen create set,set pen spectrum
10,64,0:08:00,Jamie,patterns by moving on plain white paper,pattern moving plain white paper,plain pattern moving
4,67,0:08:00,Tony,yeah well we should  the impetus for this is that clients come up with ,well impetus client come,client impetus come
5,68,0:08:00,Tony,this new rainbow media and we can print thermo reactive dyes onto er ,new rainbow medium print thermo reactive dye onto er,thermo print reactive
6,69,0:08:00,Tony,media substrates and then when you heat them up they cool to reach the ,medium substrate heat cool reach,reach medium cool
7,70,0:08:00,Tony,colour they're supposed to be so we've done some test prints on this ,colour supposed done test print,supposed print colour
8,71,0:08:00,Tony,erm been tested      by the HP      boss,erm tested hp bos,bos erm hp
9,73,0:08:00,Tony,       and playing with hot air      miraculously a colour image ,playing hot air miraculously colour image,miraculously hot air
10,74,0:08:00,Tony,appears out of a blank sheet of paper so providing we could provide a ,appears blank sheet paper providing could provide,provide paper providing
11,75,0:08:00,Tony,heat source then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper ,heat source could reveal anything printed paper,printed paper reveal
12,76,0:08:00,Tony,now technically that's more demanding because energising the entire    ,technically demanding energising entire,demanding energising entire
13,77,0:08:00,Tony, printout takes time hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding ,printout take time hammer battery quite demanding,demanding printout battery
14,78,0:08:00,Tony,thing to do so technically the stuff where you've got a low percentage fill ,thing technically stuff got low percentage fill,stuff percentage technically
15,79,0:08:00,Tony,sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable but if we ,sort face text thing lot realisable,text realisable face
16,80,0:09:00,Tony,could do that with the media,could medium,medium could
17,82,0:09:00,Tony,whether we could do that with this adaptation I don't know,whether could adaptation know,adaptation could know
11,83,0:09:00,Jamie,the one on the right  the one on the right doesn't actually have to be a ,one right one right doe actually,doe actually one
12,84,0:09:00,Jamie,thermal pen      it could just be ,thermal pen could,pen thermal could
85,85,0:09:00,AJ,it could be a soldering iron,could soldering iron,iron soldering could
0,87,0:09:00,Charles,or a hot air     ,hot air,air hot
89,89,0:09:00,AJ,but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the ,basically th focus moment basically th,basically focus moment
90,90,0:09:00,AJ,idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,idea thermal print nib pen,print pen idea
92,92,0:09:00,AJ,whichever shape that takes now with that concept there are a number of ,whichever shape take concept number,shape concept number
93,93,0:09:00,AJ,specific problems that need to be overcome and I think that's what we ,specific problem need overcome,specific overcome problem
94,94,0:09:00,AJ,want to focus on today in the mechanical brainstorm and then on Monday ,want focus today mechanical brainstorm monday,today mechanical brainstorm
95,95,0:09:00,AJ,there's an electronics brainstorm as well errm that will cover a range of ,electronics brainstorm well errm cover range,range electronics brainstorm
96,96,0:09:00,AJ,other topics so basically the first problem that we need to think about is ,topic basically first problem need,problem topic basically
97,97,0:09:00,AJ,the wobbly arm movement of the users this is aimed at potentially but not ,wobbly arm movement user aimed potentially,user movement aimed
98,98,0:09:00,AJ,exclusively at five to eleven years olds who have some writing skill but not ,exclusively five eleven year old writing skill,skill year writing
99,99,0:09:00,AJ,fantastic writing skill they're likely to hold the pen different ways errm ,fantastic writing skill likely hold pen different way errm,errm fantastic skill
100,100,0:09:00,AJ,different angles etcetera and so ther there's two important things one is ,different angle etcetera ther two important thing one,ther important thing
101,101,0:10:00,AJ,with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to ,respect concept one printout need,printout respect concept
102,102,0:10:00,AJ,stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print so there needs to ,stay contact thermal print paper actual print need,print paper stay
103,103,0:10:00,AJ,be this contact maintained and the other thing is the printout needs to stay ,contact maintained thing printout need stay,stay thing contact
104,104,0:10:00,AJ,in the right angle to print as well so we need to think of designs that ,right angle print well need design,print angle design
105,105,0:10:00,AJ,actually help to do that even though the user is not capable of keeping ,actually help even though user capable keeping,user keeping capable
106,106,0:10:00,AJ,exactly the right shape or weight so one of the things that we asked in the ,exactly right shape weight one thing asked,shape weight thing
107,107,0:10:00,AJ,erm brainstor pre brainstorm homework I don't know if any of you have ,erm brainstor pre brainstorm homework know,homework erm brainstor
108,108,0:10:00,AJ,done this is to come up with some ideas as to other products or ,done come idea product,product idea come
109,109,0:10:00,AJ,situations where a product needs to follow a contour or needs to be able to ,situation product need follow contour need able,product follow situation
110,110,0:10:00,AJ,adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment even thought the user ,adjust keeping alignment even thought user,thought user adjust
111,111,0:10:00,AJ,might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on ,might moving thing anybody come idea,moving idea thing
115,115,0:10:00,AJ,you have? excellent sorry Tom you have a question?,excellent sorry tom question,excellent question tom
0,116,0:10:00,Tom,are th these  are we limit limitin ourselves to these objects or ,th limit limitin object,limit limitin object
117,117,0:11:00,AJ,at the moment we're limiting ourselves to these two and then there's some ,moment limiting two,limiting moment two
120,120,0:11:00,AJ,there are some bigger issues as well ,bigger issue well,bigger issue well
122,122,0:11:00,AJ,yeah but we thought we'd start with these first because they're real ,thought start first real,thought real start
123,123,0:11:00,AJ,problems that we're currently thinking right how are we going to ,problem currently thinking right going,problem thinking right
126,126,0:11:00,AJ,so there's most value in in starting with that probably,value starting probably,starting probably value
0,127,0:11:00,Sarah,could I just ask a quick question?,could ask quick question,quick question ask
1,129,0:11:00,Sarah,is it is it only paper you're thinking about or could it be other things like ,paper thinking could thing,thinking paper thing
2,130,0:11:00,Sarah,mugs or fabric or pottery,mug fabric pottery,fabric mug pottery
13,131,0:11:00,Jamie,it could be anything,could anything,anything could
3,132,0:11:00,Sarah,it could be anything,could anything,anything could
134,134,0:11:00,AJ,yeah I guess it could be all those,guess could,guess could
136,136,0:11:00,AJ,potentially it could be yeah     what did you come up with Jamie,potentially could come jamie,potentially jamie come
14,137,0:11:00,Jamie,I ended up with the   hold on   sledge,ended hold sledge,ended hold sledge
138,138,0:11:00,AJ,the sledge excellent,sledge excellent,excellent sledge
15,141,0:11:00,Jamie,well the sledge manages to keep level by having quite a wide base and ,well sledge manages keep level quite wide base,sledge manages base
16,142,0:11:00,Jamie,then a main force in the middle so unlike the set of skis where quite ,main force middle unlike set ski quite,set unlike ski
17,143,0:11:00,Jamie,narrow and you go up on an edge ,narrow go edge,edge narrow go
18,147,0:12:00,Jamie,the sledge is er quite broad and then you have the weight right in the ,sledge er quite broad weight right,sledge weight broad
19,148,0:12:00,Jamie,middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow ,middle manage keep runner snow,runner middle snow
20,150,0:12:00,Jamie,more often than say a sledge or a snowboar  a skis or snowboard,often say sledge snowboar ski snowboard,snowboar ski snowboard
151,151,0:12:00,AJ,so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the ,would potential see guiders almost,guiders potential almost
21,153,0:12:00,Jamie,well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be to ,well guess easiest way keep pen right angle would,easiest pen angle
22,154,0:12:00,Jamie,have a set of stabilisers on it ,set stabiliser,set stabiliser
23,156,0:12:00,Jamie,based on the idea of a sledge,based idea sledge,based idea sledge
157,157,0:12:00,AJ,yeah no problem    stabilisers    like a bicycle yeah that's a good ,problem stabiliser bicycle good,bicycle good problem
158,158,0:12:00,AJ,idea any other things that that sort of generated? either for you or for ,idea thing sort generated either,sort idea thing
159,159,0:12:00,AJ,anybody else?,anybody else,anybody else
1,160,0:12:00,Charles,I was thinking that sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal ,wa thinking sort maybe flat base sort universal,sort thinking universal
2,161,0:12:00,Charles,joint like a windsurf mast,joint windsurf mast,joint mast windsurf
3,163,0:12:00,Charles,if the      is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at ,stay flat bit hold onto,hold bit flat
4,164,0:12:00,Charles,different angles,different angle,angle different
5,168,0:13:00,Charles,I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either ,guess size thing contact paper could either,paper guess size
6,169,0:13:00,Charles,have a very small contact area and er track where it goes or you can have a ,small contact area er track go,small er area
7,170,0:13:00,Charles,wide contact  area  ,wide contact area,area contact wide
24,171,0:13:00,Jamie, show the relative size of the pen if you've got an ,show relative size pen got,show relative size
173,173,0:13:00,AJ,er can do but yeah OK go on then,er ok go,er go ok
18,174,0:13:00,Tony,its' probably worth yeah I think ,probably worth,worth probably
25,175,0:13:00,Jamie,look at the end of that,look end,end look
19,176,0:13:00,Tony,size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,size dictated cost really need quite narrow,dictated size cost
26,179,0:13:00,Jamie,could be a      that way,could way,could way
180,180,0:13:00,AJ,lets just use that as guidance but let’s  let’s not be too preoccupied with the ,let use guidance let u let u preoccupied,guidance preoccupied let
181,181,0:13:00,AJ,shape that is at the moment we'll just look at the tip of that  ,shape moment look tip,tip moment shape
183,183,0:13:00,AJ,rather than the rest I would suggest,rather rest would suggest,rest suggest rather
27,184,0:13:00,Jamie,it can be te  ten mil across,te ten mil across,ten mil te
1,185,0:13:00,Tom,and its it's a its not an edge one then it's a it's a on the flat there ,edge one flat,edge flat one
2,186,0:14:00,Tom,are two flats printing aren't there more than one,two flat printing one,flat printing one
3,190,0:14:00,Tom,if I where yeah the resistors sit on the lump there and ,resistor sit lump,lump resistor sit
4,191,0:14:00,Tom,you've got the type where the resistors sit on this corner here,got type resistor sit corner,sit resistor corner
28,192,0:14:00,Jamie,it's a corner one,corner one,corner one
5,193,0:14:00,Tom,it's a corner one,corner one,corner one
29,194,0:14:00,Jamie,oh right ish,right ish,ish right
6,199,0:14:00,Tom,it'll be about fifty percent more expensive,fifty percent expensive,expensive fifty percent
7,201,0:14:00,Tom,there's an end that goes over the paper isn't there sort of thing?,end go paper sort thing,sort paper end
20,202,0:14:00,Tony,there's a type that does this as well though,type doe well though,doe type though
21,204,0:14:00,Tony,but they type that we've got is like this but in actual fact its much more ,type got actual fact much,type actual fact
22,205,0:14:00,Tony,biased      towards the edge,biased towards edge,biased edge towards
23,207,0:14:00,Tony,so you normally have a a slight overlay here,normally slight overlay,overlay slight normally
8,208,0:14:00,Tom,right so easiest thing obviously ,right easiest thing obviously,easiest thing obviously
9,210,0:15:00,Tom,yeah the the typically what you do is you've got foil      going over and ,typically got foil going,foil typically going
10,211,0:15:00,Tom,you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,get quite lot know quite lot angle,lot angle know
212,212,0:15:00,AJ,so we were talking mostly about that one or that one ,talking mostly one one,talking mostly one
214,214,0:15:00,AJ,is what you're saying Toby,saying toby,toby saying
11,216,0:15:00,Tom,that one sort of plus or minus,one sort plus minus,minus sort one
30,217,0:15:00,Jamie,all these you have to keep flat or long,keep flat long,flat long keep
12,219,0:15:00,Tom,its just its just whether we need flat or long,whether need flat long,flat long need
222,222,0:15:00,AJ,yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way ,well need guidance ax whichever way,whichever ax guidance
8,226,0:15:00,Charles,could you have like you have like a hot ball like a ball point pen and ,could hot ball ball point pen,ball pen hot
9,227,0:15:00,Charles,then you had a tracker like an optical mast then I think that picture where ,tracker optical mast picture,mast optical picture
10,228,0:15:00,Charles,you're moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns ,moving pen across paper sort pattern repeating pattern,pattern pen repeating
11,229,0:15:00,Charles,instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just ,instead one go wide printer would,printer wide one
12,230,0:15:00,Charles,do a thin line at a time but when you scribble backwards and forwards it ,thin line time scribble backwards forward,thin line backwards
13,231,0:16:00,Charles,would build up and use that tracking capability to do that and you ,would build use tracking capability,tracking build capability
14,232,0:16:00,Charles,wouldn't have the angle problem ,would angle problem,angle problem would
31,235,0:16:00,Jamie,yeah the problem is that printing      on the ball     ,problem printing ball,ball printing problem
15,236,0:16:00,Charles,we thought the ball could just be  you could just sort of turn it off and on,thought ball could could sort turn,thought sort ball
16,239,0:16:00,Charles,so its like  instead of being a thing ,instead thing,thing instead
32,240,0:16:00,Jamie,there is a bit of that OK,bit ok,bit ok
17,241,0:16:00,Charles,well I suppose you could make the width of the print ,well suppose could make width print,suppose print width
245,245,0:16:00,AJ,     with the dots though      very very small you can only they've got ,dot though small got,dot small got
246,246,0:16:00,AJ,such low they'll last      you heat them up very very briefly and then ,low last heat briefly,briefly heat low
247,247,0:16:00,AJ,they'll go cold again ,go cold,cold go
249,249,0:16:00,AJ,probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,probably get spot appearing second one erm,erm spot appearing
24,254,0:16:00,Tony,  at the moment what we've got available for a ,moment got available,moment available got
25,255,0:16:00,Tony,demonstrator is one of the types on the left so we do have this constraint ,demonstrator one type left constraint,left constraint demonstrator
26,256,0:17:00,Tony,of what that angle needs to be,angle need,angle need
27,260,0:17:00,Tony,yes that's going to limit us for the time being ,going limit u time,limit time going
28,262,0:17:00,Tony,if if it progresses beyond the demonstrator phase then I think we could ,progress beyond demonstrator phase could,phase demonstrator progress
29,263,0:17:00,Tony,open up more options by going for alternatives but we're not prepared to ,open option going alternative prepared,option open alternative
30,264,0:17:00,Tony,invest in two weeks work      whereas at the moment we're capitalising      ,invest two week work whereas moment capitalising,week work capitalising

266,266,0:17:00,AJ,OK I think if we started with that I mean that's obviously where one of the ,ok started mean obviously one,started one mean
267,267,0:17:00,AJ,issues comes from and so if we try and work with that and try and work ,issue come work work,work issue come
268,268,0:17:00,AJ,around that by having some sort of guidance or whatever that would ,around sort guidance whatever would,guidance sort around
269,269,0:17:00,AJ,be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base to keep ,good mentioned windsurfs sort base keep,sort windsurfs base
270,270,0:17:00,AJ,the  to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform ,hold rather actual hand stabilised platform,platform hold actual

7,279,0:18:00,Sarah,moves in one axis ,move one axis,axis move one
8,281,0:18:00,Sarah,rather than round     ,rather round,round rather
282,282,0:18:00,AJ,it doesn't its almost flat isn't it I suppose,doe almost flat suppose,suppose doe flat
284,284,0:18:00,AJ,yeah it doesn't move that way I don't think,doe move way,doe move way
285,285,0:18:00,AJ,yeah let’s not go to far from what we really have to do cos you want  to ,let u go far really co want,really go co
286,286,0:18:00,AJ,keep      flat on the paper all the time,keep flat paper time,flat time paper
33,289,0:18:00,Jamie,does the razor stay flat though because the centre piece is much        ,doe razor stay flat though centre piece much,piece flat stay
9,290,0:18:00,Sarah, I'm not sure whether it does  completely stay flat I think there might be a ,sure whether doe completely stay flat might,completely stay flat
10,291,0:18:00,Sarah,little bit of a plain but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I ,little bit plain main axis razor ha way,main ha razor
293,293,0:18:00,AJ,if I  if I remember correctly from  I don't know about this but from the ,remember correctly know,correctly remember know
294,294,0:18:00,AJ,other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,razor blade ha little spring side,side spring blade
296,296,0:18:00,AJ,which means each blade can independently of housing can move that way ,mean blade independently housing move way,move independently blade
297,297,0:18:00,AJ,a little bit as well cant it? so that's ,little bit well cant,bit cant little
32,298,0:19:00,Tony,how’s that achieved that? is that is that achieved by a plastic that's ,achieved achieved plastic,achieved plastic
301,301,0:19:00,AJ,a spring that goes to surface,spring go surface,spring surface go
13,304,0:19:00,Tom,there’s f five of the razors isn't there ,five razor,razor five
0,307,0:19:00,Robert,I’ve brought some examples along      there’s one with a single spring in the ,brought example along one single spring,single spring brought
311,311,0:19:00,AJ,these are electric ones yeah?,electric one,electric one
1,312,0:19:00,Robert,yeah yeah these are      electric razors      and so this is ,electric razor,electric razor
313,313,0:19:00,AJ,your housemates are not going to be pleased ,housemate going pleased,housemate pleased going
2,315,0:19:00,Robert,slightly more expensive version that's got a spring either side ,slightly expensive version got spring either side,slightly side spring
33,316,0:19:00,Tony,yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,give adjustment slide surface,adjustment give slide
3,319,0:19:00,Robert,they do yeah there’s its one with the foils basically because on this the ,one foil basically,basically foil one
4,320,0:20:00,Robert,foil is sprung this one is well no the foil will run through rubbers and it ,foil sprung one well foil run rubber,foil sprung rubber
5,321,0:20:00,Robert,uses the the cutting edge that's sprung,us cutting edge sprung,cutting edge sprung
14,323,0:20:00,Tom,erm there’s a point here as well that do we need to keep  because this ,erm point well need keep,point erm need
15,324,0:20:00,Tom,will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won’t it?,keep even well relatively constant pressure,pressure constant relatively
16,326,0:20:00,Tom,and you could also you could add a switch to this so you could switch it ,could also could add switch could switch,switch add also
34,328,0:20:00,Tony,yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well,thing might well,thing might well
35,330,0:20:00,Tony,because it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it ,might control force print head make sure,print make control
36,331,0:20:00,Tony,comes on how you want it to,come want,come want
333,333,0:20:00,AJ,there were other problems that we're coming to later on as well,problem coming later well,coming problem later
34,335,0:20:00,Jamie,so is that what you call a gimble?,call gimble,call gimble
336,336,0:20:00,AJ,right OK go we're done thanks very much,right ok go done thanks much,right much done
37,339,0:20:00,Tony,I’ve got another one,got another one,another got one
340,340,0:21:00,AJ,OK yeah go on,ok go,go ok
38,341,0:21:00,Tony,it builds on another one,build another one,build another one
39,343,0:21:00,Tony,and it goes faster,go faster,faster go
344,344,0:21:00,AJ,top trumps ,top trump,top trump
40,346,0:21:00,Tony,but      as well its one of the things about this is that you've got the ,well one thing got,thing got one
41,347,0:21:00,Tony,main lump and then you've got steering piece towards the front which is ,main lump got steering piece towards front,piece main steering
42,348,0:21:00,Tony,so you've got  I guess you've ,got guess,guess got
43,349,0:21:00,Tony,kind of got the main unit that has got all the power and weight in it and ,kind got main unit ha got power weight,power main unit
44,350,0:21:00,Tony,then the flexible bit that does the steering,flexible bit doe steering,bit doe flexible
351,351,0:21:00,AJ,can I just explore that a little bit further is that something that we could ,explore little bit something could,explore bit little
352,352,0:21:00,AJ,consider where I know we're talking about a pen and you immediately ,consider know talking pen immediately,pen talking immediately
353,353,0:21:00,AJ,think about something that's this sort of shape that you can hold in your ,something sort shape hold,hold shape sort
354,354,0:21:00,AJ,hand like that but considering we're talking about toys in effect for ,hand considering talking toy effect,talking hand toy
357,357,0:22:00,AJ,could it be something that takes more of the shape of a of a train with,could something take shape train,shape train could
358,358,0:22:00,AJ,something else that gets pulled behind it for example,something else get pulled behind example,pulled example behind
361,361,0:22:00,AJ,erm yeah something that's much more of a quite a different shape that ,erm something much quite different shape,shape erm much
362,362,0:22:00,AJ,doesn’t require them to have that difficult sort of hold things in place like ,doe require difficult sort hold thing place,require place sort
363,363,0:22:00,AJ,this because that's one of the challenges children have isn't it?,one challenge child,challenge child one
365,365,0:22:00,AJ,holding the pen at the right angle,holding pen right angle,angle holding pen
17,367,0:22:00,Tom,     that's probably one of the things you want to teach a child though isn't ,probably one thing want teach child though,thing teach child
45,369,0:22:00,Tony,yeah well you could take all of the difficult stuff off them and make it ,well could take difficult stuff make,stuff make difficult
46,370,0:22:00,Tony,happen not that they'll do is move the lump around,happen move lump around,move happen lump
372,372,0:22:00,AJ,so you'll teach them how to move a mouse about,teach move mouse,mouse move teach
11,373,0:22:00,Sarah,if there’s a skill in that there’s a sense of achievement,skill sense achievement,achievement sense skill
18,374,0:22:00,Charles,we could have like a mouse rather than a pen that could just be a different ,could mouse rather pen could different,pen mouse could
19,375,0:22:00,Charles,starting point,starting point,point starting
47,376,0:22:00,Tony,all they have to do is put it on the table then move it around and it does ,put table move around doe,put move table
48,377,0:23:00,Tony,everything else,everything else,else everything
12,378,0:23:00,Sarah,I was thinking a different media than just a flat piece of paper ,wa thinking different medium flat piece paper,piece paper thinking
13,380,0:23:00,Sarah,a pens quite a nice sort of you know to get round angles and,pen quite nice sort know get round angle,pen nice round
6,382,0:23:00,Robert,do you think a mouse would allow you to apply that constant force that ,mouse would allow apply constant force,constant mouse apply
7,383,0:23:00,Robert,we need for this though,need though,need though
49,384,0:23:00,Tony,erm yeah I don't see why not I mean as long as the force is not going to ,erm see mean long force going,long erm force
50,385,0:23:00,Tony,push the mouse into the table then gravity should be on your side shouldn’t ,push mouse table gravity side,side push gravity
387,387,0:23:00,AJ,can I just clarify that you mean for the main lump to have all the sort of ,clarify mean main lump sort,main clarify lump
388,388,0:23:00,AJ,the weighty bits like the batteries and electronics and things like that or ,weighty bit battery electronics thing,thing electronics battery
51,390,0:23:00,Tony,erm I wasn't really being that prescriptive,erm wa really prescriptive,erm prescriptive wa
391,391,0:23:00,AJ,OK fine OK well anybody bring any other ,ok fine ok well anybody bring,bring fine anybody
18,392,0:23:00,Tom,I haven't brought much ,brought much,brought much
19,394,0:23:00,Tom,cos I didn’t think there’s a problem,co problem,problem co
20,396,0:23:00,Tom,if you ever go without it’s not too bad but it made me think,ever go without bad made,made bad go
21,397,0:23:00,Tom,in the means of a toy I have a quick problem because well I don't know ,mean toy quick problem well know,quick problem toy
22,398,0:24:00,Tom,if everyone’s seen it you can get a my son has a like a ghost it's a ,everyone seen get son ha ghost,ha ghost son
23,399,0:24:00,Tom,little ghost it’s about you know an inch high,little ghost know inch high,inch ghost high
24,401,0:24:00,Tom,what its got inside is its got and I can’t remember exactly ,got inside got cannot remember exactly,inside remember cannot
25,402,0:24:00,Tom,what its got inside its got a rubber a wheel which printed on it has a little ,got inside got rubber wheel printed ha little,ha inside rubber
26,403,0:24:00,Tom,erm I don't know why I'm telling you all this because its not really ,erm know telling really,erm telling know
404,404,0:24:00,AJ,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  you mean one of those footprint things,mean one footprint thing,footprint thing mean
27,405,0:24:00,Tom,its  got       it's got little footprints,got got little footprint,footprint got little
406,406,0:24:00,AJ,one of those  tablet  things that you write on is that what you mean?,one tablet thing write mean,thing tablet write
28,409,0:24:00,Tom,he must have got it from a cereal packet or something its like a little er  ,must got cereal packet something little er,er cereal packet
29,410,0:24:00,Tom,what’s kind of erm,kind erm,erm kind
30,412,0:24:00,Tom,yeah it's a self and yeah its got a pad an inky pad here and he,self got pad inky pad,pad inky got
35,413,0:24:00,Jamie,does that go all over the walls and everything?,doe go wall everything,doe wall everything
31,416,0:24:00,Tom,you walk it along a page,walk along page,page walk along
32,418,0:25:00,Tom,and it makes footprints,make footprint,footprint make
14,419,0:25:00,Sarah,that’s interesting cos I was thinking pastry brush you know how pastry ,interesting co wa thinking pastry brush know pastry,pastry wa thinking
15,422,0:25:00,Sarah,and white line machines but I couldn't think of anything that quite tied into ,white line machine could anything quite tied,tied machine white
16,423,0:25:00,Sarah,this but the idea of a wheel ,idea wheel,idea wheel
17,425,0:25:00,Sarah,pushing a wheel along,pushing wheel along,pushing wheel along
33,426,0:25:00,Tom,that's a obviously this is a mechanical way of doing what we're talking ,obviously mechanical way talking,mechanical talking obviously
34,427,0:25:00,Tom,about so it could the thing could look like like a character couldn't ,could thing could look character could,character thing could
36,431,0:25:00,Jamie,I guess this idea Tom was that this is the print head here and this quite a ,guess idea tom wa print head quite,tom print guess
37,432,0:25:00,Jamie,wide like a caravan      is that      angles that can hold that to feel it because ,wide caravan angle hold feel,hold feel angle
38,433,0:25:00,Jamie,if you know if he goes then this digs into ,know go dig,dig go know
435,435,0:25:00,AJ,so you could even have three wheels couldn't you three small wheels to ,could even three wheel could three small wheel,wheel small three
436,436,0:25:00,AJ,sort of drive it,sort drive,drive sort
52,437,0:25:00,Tony,you could      couldn't you? and you could have a cross section it ,could could could cross section,cross section could
53,438,0:25:00,Tony,could be kind of kind of like this so you can look down here and you can ,could kind kind look,kind could look
54,439,0:25:00,Tony,see the whole from there to there ,see whole,see whole
55,441,0:26:00,Tony,see where you're going and you could stick three ball bearings in here and ,see going could stick three ball bearing,bearing ball stick
56,442,0:26:00,Tony,just roll around on the surface,roll around surface,roll surface around
57,444,0:26:00,Tony,and obviously see where your feet are going,obviously see foot going,foot going obviously
58,446,0:26:00,Tony,its just so you could acquire lots of stuff where you're actually marking     ,could acquire lot stuff actually marking,marking stuff acquire
35,448,0:26:00,Tom,yeah its sort of it's a compromise between here with a pen you want ,sort compromise pen want,compromise pen sort
36,449,0:26:00,Tom,to see what you're doing don't you you want to see ,see want see,see want
37,451,0:26:00,Tom,but with this type of toy you don't do you?,type toy,toy type
20,453,0:26:00,Charles,probably aware      pattern appears as an edge so you can go right up to ,probably aware pattern appears edge go right,appears pattern edge
21,455,0:26:00,Charles,rather that the middle of something big if its big than it doesn't matter ,rather middle something big big doe matter,big middle matter
22,456,0:26:00,Charles,much so long as its at an edge of the big thing where the ,much long edge big thing,long big edge
457,457,0:26:00,AJ,but even with paper      suppose you could still get to it its not like ,even paper suppose could still get,paper suppose still
458,458,0:26:00,AJ,hoovering a room when you can't get to an edge is it ,hoovering room cannot get edge,hoovering room edge
59,459,0:26:00,Tony,it becomes more complex to the user as well you can rotate it so you can ,becomes complex user well rotate,user rotate complex
60,460,0:26:00,Tony,get to this corner or ,get corner,corner get
61,462,0:26:00,Tony,rotate it to get to that one,rotate get one,rotate get one
463,463,0:26:00,AJ,yeah it’s an interesting idea,interesting idea,idea interesting
465,465,0:27:00,AJ,add some wheels to it any other things that people brought?,add wheel thing people brought,thing people add
23,466,0:27:00,Charles,I bought      a tram,bought tram,bought tram
469,469,0:27:00,AJ, you saw the others looking at architecture so you thought I’ll bring      ,saw others looking architecture thought bring,thought architecture bring
24,470,0:27:00,Charles,well the distance between the rails and the what I was thinking the ,well distance rail wa thinking,wa thinking distance
25,471,0:27:00,Charles,distance between the rails and the overhead wires always changing as it ,distance rail overhead wire always changing,rail distance wire
26,472,0:27:00,Charles,has to follow this articulating ,ha follow articulating,articulating follow ha
473,473,0:27:00,AJ,yeah nice idea,nice idea,idea nice
27,474,0:27:00,Charles,it’s a bit like the suspension on a car as well the car sort of has this inertia ,bit suspension car well car sort ha inertia,car inertia suspension
28,475,0:27:00,Charles,it flies along in a straight line with suspension and all sorts of things as the ,fly along straight line suspension sort thing,straight sort suspension
29,476,0:27:00,Charles,wheels pump up and down,wheel pump,pump wheel
30,479,0:27:00,Charles,as well stay in contact with the road if you've got a decent car,well stay contact road got decent car,contact decent stay
480,480,0:27:00,AJ,well that's that's the other thing I suppose we haven't considered ,well thing suppose considered,considered suppose thing
481,481,0:27:00,AJ,anything like air pockets or anything like that that could be like a little ,anything air pocket anything could little,pocket air little
31,485,0:28:00,Charles,that's the sort of thing about children they do things jerkily quickly,sort thing child thing jerkily quickly,thing sort child
62,487,0:28:00,Tony,so it didn’t get to take a,get take,get take
63,492,0:28:00,Tony,stick a big giroscope in it so they can't jerk it around,stick big giroscope cannot jerk around,stick jerk big
493,493,0:28:00,AJ,yeah OK that's a good idea Tony,ok good idea tony,good idea tony
38,495,0:28:00,Tom,we should have a target aged child here shouldn't we?,target aged child,aged child target
39,497,0:28:00,Tom,to because well I think well like this I say about this obviously it ,well well say obviously,obviously say well
40,498,0:28:00,Tom,wasn't a problem if you don't if you don't let it gimble that way then ,wa problem let gimble way,wa problem gimble
41,499,0:28:00,Tom,you'd get you can make your own lines cant you you can make different ,get make line cant make different,make line cant
42,502,0:28:00,Tom,so so it might if the if the applications for somebody who's got,might application somebody got,application got might
43,504,0:28:00,Tom,     then you add a feature by taking out you know,add feature taking know,add feature taking
44,507,0:29:00,Tom,yeah because if yeah if say if the the pen is printed in just ,say pen printed,pen printed say
45,508,0:29:00,Tom,dotted lines you can you can if this pen if you don't let it go that way you ,dotted line pen let go way,line dotted pen
46,509,0:29:00,Tom,could make it print dotted line print dotted line ,could make print dotted line print dotted line,line print dotted
510,510,0:29:00,AJ,oh so you just have you just have one print out one ,one print one,print one
39,513,0:29:00,Jamie,so I guess what you're saying is any mechanism you can have it switch on ,guess saying mechanism switch,guess mechanism switch
40,514,0:29:00,Jamie,switch off one could be easy line      and then you can switch it off so that ,switch one could easy line switch,switch line easy
47,516,0:29:00,Tom,you could use it just so at the corner of the  printer ,could use corner printer,corner printer could
32,517,0:29:00,Charles,well you could do that just by activating one of the channels on the grid,well could activating one channel grid,grid activating channel
64,519,0:29:00,Tony,I think that's the way to do it because otherwise you can overheat the print ,way otherwise overheat print,overheat print otherwise
65,520,0:29:00,Tony,head and might damage it so part of the thing here is we need to hold ,head might damage part thing need hold,part thing damage
66,521,0:31:00,Tony,it down otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there’s no where for ,otherwise going overheat firing,firing overheat going
67,522,0:31:00,Tony,the heat to go,heat go,heat go
48,523,0:31:00,Tom,could we put can we detect the heat that the      and therefore switch ,could put detect heat therefore switch,heat switch detect
49,526,0:31:00,Tom,or know what’s going on?,know going,going know
68,527,0:31:00,Tony,er that's only going to stop it  getting dangerously hot ,er going getting dangerously hot,hot dangerously er
69,529,0:31:00,Tony,     all we need to do for print quality and performance and things is to ,need print quality performance thing,quality print thing
70,530,0:31:00,Tony,keep those dots on the paper when they're being fired,keep dot paper fired,dot fired paper
531,531,0:31:00,AJ,the other thing which you will picture sort of to an extent that one as ,thing picture sort extent one,sort picture extent
532,532,0:31:00,AJ,well is the actual steering is actually at the moment the hand steers it ,well actual steering actually moment hand steer,steer moment steering
533,533,0:31:00,AJ,directly by making movements with the hand but if you had like a ,directly making movement hand,directly hand making
536,536,0:31:00,AJ,that then moved the angle of the print head errm that might work too but ,moved angle print head errm might work,moved work print
537,537,0:31:00,AJ,maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,maybe bit expensive suppose,bit expensive suppose
8,538,0:31:00,Robert,I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the ,interesting thing use steer built,thing steer built
9,539,0:31:00,Robert,steering actually tilts the whole body as it steers ,steering actually tilt whole body steer,steer tilt body
10,541,0:31:00,Robert,so in order to maintain that angle,order maintain angle,angle maintain order
11,543,0:31:00,Robert,it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,compensates lean rider corner,compensates corner lean
12,547,0:31:00,Robert,so if we had something like that you could steer this angle of the pen as it ,something could steer angle pen,pen angle steer
13,548,0:31:00,Robert,moves to the other end,move end,end move
71,550,0:31:00,Tony,its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well      its ,taken u probably three place go either well,place three probably
72,551,0:31:00,Tony,something you control or you take all the opportunities for control away ,something control take opportunity control away,control opportunity away
73,552,0:31:00,Tony,from people apart from moving around and you make the pen or whatever ,people apart moving around make pen whatever,moving pen make
74,555,0:32:00,Tony,erm or we give some feedback so that people know when they're ,erm give feedback people know,give erm feedback
75,556,0:32:00,Tony,doing the right thing,right thing,thing right
76,559,0:32:00,Tony,erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way but it forces ,erm last one possible hold wrong way force,force wrong erm
77,560,0:32:00,Tony,you to hold it the right way possibly      ,hold right way possibly,hold possibly right
78,562,0:32:00,Tony,that's four things not three things,four thing three thing,thing four three
50,564,0:32:00,Tom,well for the the third you can make it somehow make it compliant to  I ,well third make somehow make compliant,make compliant somehow
51,565,0:32:00,Tom,know I know what you're saying but it would be difficult because you ,know know saying would difficult,difficult know saying
52,566,0:32:00,Tom,would overheat the edge of the print head if its not touching but there ,would overheat edge print head touching,touching overheat edge
53,567,0:32:00,Tom,could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads ,could electronics maybe saying end print head,head print end
54,568,0:32:00,Tom,overheating it must be touching at the other end so I’ll switch this ,overheating must touching end switch,switch overheating end
79,569,0:32:00,Tony,yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,probably must way detecting,detecting must probably
570,570,0:32:00,AJ,     can I just explore that last one in a little more detail because when ,explore last one little detail,explore detail last
571,571,0:33:00,AJ,organisations  making sure they can only be correct in one way so the ,organisation making sure correct one way,organisation correct making
572,572,0:33:00,AJ,design and shape of the thing so it can only be done in one way and that’s ,design shape thing done one way,shape design thing
573,573,0:33:00,AJ,the correct way because then there is less sort of learning to be done by ,correct way le sort learning done,sort le correct
574,574,0:33:00,AJ,the user and children I think if they are you know if they don't get the ,user child know get,child user get
575,575,0:33:00,AJ,results pretty quickly they'll just give up on it so it would be quite ,result pretty quickly give would quite,result quickly give
576,576,0:33:00,AJ,good shape of it would only let it work in one particular way,good shape would let work one particular way,good shape work
33,578,0:33:00,Charles,you could build it in different ways so you could have it so that there was ,could build different way could wa,wa build different
34,579,0:33:00,Charles,only one way of doing it,one way,one way
35,581,0:33:00,Charles,but then you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it  ,switch supposing supposing,supposing switch
36,582,0:33:00,Charles,you've got the print head and three balls around it to support it with ,got print head three ball around support,head print support
37,583,0:33:00,Charles,pressure sensors on those balls so if the child presses harder it activates all ,pressure sensor ball child press harder activates,press harder pressure
38,584,0:33:00,Charles,the bearings and prints out a very heavy line ,bearing print heavy line,bearing heavy line
39,586,0:33:00,Charles,but if the child doesn't press hard then you activate every other one so you ,child doe press hard activate every one,hard press activate
40,587,0:33:00,Charles,get a faint line so   the actual kind of the the print head ,get faint line actual kind print head,kind head line
41,588,0:34:00,Charles,is isolated from what the child’s doing but the sensors ,isolated child sensor,child isolated sensor
42,590,0:34:00,Charles,attend to what the child’s doing and the thing responds accordingly,attend child thing responds accordingly,responds child thing
55,592,0:34:00,Tom,and so you can trick the child into doing,trick child,child trick
43,595,0:34:00,Charles,and you could also make it so that even if the child’s because erm,could also make even child erm,erm make child
44,596,0:34:00,Charles,its not direct you can make it sort of software so that even if the ,direct make sort software even,software make direct
45,597,0:34:00,Charles,child’s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result but if the ,child really uncoordinated basically get reasonable result,reasonable uncoordinated result
46,598,0:34:00,Charles,child’s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,child coordinated actually quite sophisticated thing,sophisticated coordinated thing
600,600,0:34:00,AJ,you could even have sort of some feedback in terms of colour LEDs on ,could even sort feedback term colour led,led feedback sort
601,601,0:34:00,AJ,the pen saying that he's done a good or she's done a good job or ,pen saying done good done good job,good pen job
56,604,0:34:00,Tom,that's a bit  that's a bit peachy I think somehow,bit bit peachy somehow,bit peachy somehow
57,606,0:34:00,Tom,yeah you know because i if they're doing something and it produces a ,know something produce,produce know something
58,609,0:34:00,Tom,that's what they want and saying well done isn't really you know so what ,want saying well done really know,want really done
59,610,0:35:00,Tom,my parents taught me,parent taught,parent taught
611,611,0:35:00,AJ,you obviously have a specific parenting philosophy,obviously specific parenting philosophy,specific parenting philosophy
616,616,0:35:00,AJ,well I did warn you to be politically correct,well warn politically correct,correct politically warn
41,620,0:35:00,Jamie,     the dot and the ring you the dot if it goes off centre you know the dots ,dot ring dot go centre know dot,dot ring centre
42,621,0:35:00,Jamie,outside the ring the pen won’t work so you've got to come in,outside ring pen work got come,pen work ring
18,622,0:35:00,Sarah,could we sorry could we actually see what they're doing I mean are they ,could sorry could actually see mean,see mean actually
19,623,0:35:00,Sarah,drawing pictures or making invitations or Christmas cards or ,drawing picture making invitation christmas card,making drawing card
80,624,0:35:00,Tony,erm      we're going to try to deal with that a fair bit on Monday,erm going deal fair bit monday,fair erm bit
81,626,0:35:00,Tony,as well as electronics and some of the control and user interface features ,well electronics control user interface feature,user feature control
82,627,0:35:00,Tony,and things whereas this kind of functional end of the mechanics we'll ,thing whereas kind functional end mechanic,thing kind end
20,629,0:35:00,Sarah,it does affect a little bit ,doe affect little bit,affect bit doe
83,630,0:35:00,Tony,it does yeah you're right,doe right,doe right
60,633,0:36:00,Tom,yeah because its really hard to draw a picture with a mouse isn't it?,really hard draw picture mouse,picture mouse draw
47,636,0:36:00,Charles,you could have games built into it couldn't you? you could have ,could game built could could,built game could
48,637,0:36:00,Charles,something like colouring in could try and tell you on some screen or try ,something colouring could tell screen,screen colouring something
49,638,0:36:00,Charles,some sort of coordination task,sort coordination task,coordination sort task
84,640,0:36:00,Tony,there’s a huge amount of possibilities you could do mazes or anything with ,huge amount possibility could maze anything,maze possibility amount
644,644,0:36:00,AJ,once we’ve explored this in more detail we’ll come onto because the other ,explored detail come onto,detail explored come
645,645,0:36:00,AJ,thing that you use to make sure things are level that's come out in the sort of ,thing use make sure thing level come sort,thing sort make
646,646,0:36:00,AJ,DIY world is these laser levellers and things like that if you had like a little ,diy world laser leveller thing little,thing leveller diy
647,647,0:36:00,AJ,laser that made sure that it was level of some sort you know the child ,laser made sure wa level sort know child,made level sort
648,648,0:36:00,AJ,can actually see a line and that its at the right angle then because they can ,actually see line right angle,angle line actually
649,649,0:36:00,AJ,see that the line is right and then that would work ,see line right would work,work line see
651,651,0:36:00,AJ,although maybe they're a bit young for that  ,although maybe bit young,bit young although
14,652,0:36:00,Robert,you could project something onto the paper in front of the pen,could project something onto paper front pen,paper pen project
85,653,0:37:00,Tony,like dam busters     ,dam buster,buster dam
43,656,0:37:00,Jamie,just like star wars,star war,star war
86,659,0:37:00,Tony,sorry guys it was a long time ago,sorry guy wa long time ago,time long ago
15,662,0:37:00,Robert,erm I was going to say an optical mouse ,erm wa going say optical mouse,optical mouse erm
664,664,0:37:00,AJ, Jamie Tony ,jamie tony,jamie tony
44,665,0:37:00,Jamie, bad joke ,bad joke,bad joke
16,668,0:37:00,Robert,I was going to say an optical mouse if you lift it off the page you can ,wa going say optical mouse lift page,page optical wa
17,669,0:37:00,Robert,actually see its got the pattern it creates separates into two areas so its when,actually see got pattern creates separate two area,area creates separate
18,670,0:37:00,Robert,it’s actually on the surface two points meet,actually surface two point meet,surface point meet
671,671,0:37:00,AJ,the other thing is  sorry I stopped you there sorry say that again,thing sorry stopped sorry say,thing stopped say
19,672,0:38:00,Robert,if you lift an optical mouse,lift optical mouse,lift mouse optical
20,674,0:38:00,Robert,slightly off the page you'll see the pattern it creates,slightly page see pattern creates,pattern creates page
675,675,0:38:00,AJ,yeah sort of the triangle thing,sort triangle thing,sort thing triangle
21,676,0:38:00,Robert,is in two sort of distinct spots,two sort distinct spot,distinct sort spot
22,678,0:38:00,Robert,and when its actually sat on the surface they match up and that's when it ,actually sat surface match,surface match sat
23,679,0:38:00,Robert,starts tracking ,start tracking,start tracking
24,682,0:38:00,Robert,well perhaps it’s not,well perhaps,perhaps well
87,683,0:38:00,Tony,turn the light on I don’t know how to operate,turn light know operate,turn light operate
25,684,0:38:00,Robert,yeah well if you left it a few minutes,well left minute,left minute well
685,685,0:38:00,AJ,the other thing I don't know if that's what you meant Tony when you ,thing know meant tony,tony meant thing
686,686,0:38:00,AJ,talked about the little light in front of the pen but if there's sort of ,talked little light front pen sort,sort talked front
687,687,0:38:00,AJ,feedback from the print head to know its in the right angle and then the ,feedback print head know right angle,print head angle
688,688,0:38:00,AJ,light goes on only but only when the print head is on there's this little light ,light go print head little light,light print head
689,689,0:38:00,AJ,comes on so the child gets his feedback that way oh its in the right ,come child get feedback way right,feedback child get
690,690,0:38:00,AJ,direction so I can draw,direction draw,direction draw
26,691,0:38:00,Robert,I think if I was in their shoes using this I'd prefer they’d be something where ,wa shoe using would prefer would something,wa prefer shoe
27,692,0:39:00,Robert,I decide whether its in the right position or whether I want something ,decide whether right position whether want something,decide position want
28,693,0:39:00,Robert,lighting up and saying der derrr  ,lighting saying der derrr,der derrr lighting
29,695,0:39:00,Robert,that kind of thing ,kind thing,kind thing
696,696,0:39:00,AJ,well there's a bit of training there isn't it,well bit training,bit training well
30,697,0:39:00,Robert,true but it its kind of patronising to have these sort of lights,true kind patronising sort light,sort patronising kind
21,700,0:39:00,Sarah,its not a comforting a comforting noise,comforting comforting noise,comforting noise
22,704,0:39:00,Sarah,its not its not its not a      comforting noise,comforting noise,comforting noise
705,705,0:39:00,AJ,     my wife doesn't know I stole it ,wife doe know stole,doe wife stole
707,707,0:39:00,AJ,also quite relevant because that's a product from  ,also quite relevant product,product relevant also
709,709,0:39:00,AJ, stabilser  that's just come out,stabilser come,stabilser come
31,710,0:39:00,Robert,if I run upstairs I’ve got one of those in my drawer,run upstairs got one drawer,run upstairs drawer
61,715,0:39:00,Tom,there are pens that you do have to hold in a certain orientation,pen hold certain orientation,pen hold orientation
23,716,0:40:00,Sarah,yeah I think that's what I tried its really hard because I don't hold my pen ,tried really hard hold pen,pen hard hold
24,717,0:40:00,Sarah,in the way that they expect you do ,way expect,expect way
718,718,0:40:00,AJ,they expect you to some people write like this don't they?,expect people write,expect people write
25,719,0:40:00,Sarah,that's what  I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that ,join finger top one expects,join expects finger
721,721,0:40:00,AJ,that's because you didn't have that pen when you were little,pen little,pen little
723,723,0:40:00,AJ,if you had had it you would write in the right way rather that the wrong ,would write right way rather wrong,write wrong rather
50,724,0:40:00,Charles,you would do it properly,would properly,properly would
62,728,0:40:00,Tom,you get inking pens that are really hard to use because they look they look ,get inking pen really hard use look look,hard pen inking
63,729,0:40:00,Tom,like little they they they go straight down like that,little go straight,straight go little
88,732,0:40:00,Tony,     you could have thumb holes or something like that,could thumb hole something,hole thumb could
26,733,0:40:00,Sarah,this this this one that's  this one has sort of that sort of thing,one one ha sort sort thing,sort ha thing
45,734,0:40:00,Jamie,it doesn't force you to use it but it ,doe force use,doe force use
51,736,0:40:00,Charles,     print heads,print head,head print
737,737,0:40:00,AJ,yeah we'll come to that in a minute,come minute,minute come
64,738,0:41:00,Tom,     to use straight up and down otherwise they don't  otherwise they ,use straight otherwise otherwise,straight otherwise use
65,739,0:41:00,Tom,don't work because they work thr they th they're like a little er tube and ,work work thr th little er tube,work tube er
66,740,0:41:00,Tom,when you push on it it opens a valve which lets the which lets the ,push open valve let let,valve open push
52,742,0:41:00,Charles,is that those gold and silver type things that people use  for making cards ,gold silver type thing people use making card,thing people type
67,743,0:41:00,Tom, no  it's like you get them for drafting pens I think work like that ,get drafting pen work,drafting work pen
68,744,0:41:00,Tom,they've got they're like that because they they come in different bits of ,got come different bit,bit come different
69,745,0:41:00,Tom,tube and they give you a very accurate width of line ,tube give accurate width line,tube line accurate
70,747,0:41:00,Tom,OK but you can't you cant use them in any orientation you have to use in ,ok cannot cant use orientation use,orientation ok cannot
71,753,0:41:00,Tom,and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the ,put edge would go edge,edge put go
72,754,0:42:00,Tom,tube and it just it would just sort of it just the edge just goes on you'll ,tube would sort edge go,tube sort edge
73,755,0:42:00,Tom,never get it you just crease the paper,never get crease paper,crease paper get
53,757,0:42:00,Charles,the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback's inherent isn't it if ,good thing get feedba feedback inherent,inherent thing feedba
54,758,0:42:00,Charles,you're not doing it properly it wont work,properly wont work,properly wont work
74,759,0:42:00,Tom,yeah well that's a point actually,well point actually,point actually well
75,761,0:42:00,Tom,it'll probably it'll probably be that if you do it on the edge ,probably probably edge,edge probably
76,763,0:42:00,Tom,the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the  PCB  and ,print head close enough edge pcb,pcb print close
77,764,0:42:00,Tom,you'll lift the whole the whole thing off so you probably wont be able to ,lift whole whole thing probably wont able,thing wont lift
78,765,0:42:00,Tom,do this this sort of touch towards the edge  because the  print head the ,sort touch towards edge print head,touch print edge
79,773,0:42:00,Tom,so yes yeah that that is a point actually because its   yeah,point actually,point actually
774,774,0:42:00,AJ,how do you think its gone off? how do you think that's generous in ,gone generous,generous gone
89,776,0:43:00,Tony, just the kind of thing that you could do  with the styling so it just ,kind thing could styling,thing kind styling
90,777,0:43:00,Tony,feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do if you put your ,feel right limited put,feel limited put
91,778,0:43:00,Tony,fingers in the wrong place,finger wrong place,finger place wrong
92,780,0:43:00,Tony,and if we cut all that for I mean this version it could be much chunkier ,cut mean version could much chunkier,cut chunkier version
93,782,0:43:00,Tony,and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole and perhaps ,thing could go hole lot could go hole perhaps,hole lot thing
94,783,0:43:00,Tony,you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well but you could ,mirror work left handed people well could,people mirror work
95,784,0:43:00,Tony,just make a hole to hold it in either way you'd have to certainly with the ,make hole hold either way certainly,hole hold make
96,785,0:43:00,Tony,first go realize where to put their fingers it might not even work if one of ,first go realize put finger might even work one,work finger realize
97,786,0:43:00,Tony,their fingers isn't in the right hole,finger right hole,finger hole right
46,790,0:43:00,Jamie,also you feed it back to the wrist,also feed back wrist,wrist back feed
47,792,0:43:00,Jamie,there’s all different things,different thing,thing different
27,793,0:43:00,Sarah,yeah      hand sizes as well,hand size well,hand size well
48,794,0:43:00,Jamie,you know you could you feed it back so its kind of like a watch or ,know could feed back kind watch,kind feed back
49,795,0:43:00,Jamie,something on your wrist,something wrist,wrist something
796,796,0:43:00,AJ,well you could have a battery pack in that couldn't you,well could battery pack could,battery pack could
80,800,0:44:00,Tom,if you what you do instead is if you've got      here,instead got,got instead
81,809,0:44:00,Tom,if you've got if you've got a switch there there there and there and it only ,got got switch,switch got
82,810,0:44:00,Tom,works if all four switches are down and those switch positions guarantee ,work four switch switch position guarantee,switch position work
98,812,0:44:00,Tony,yeah that's the control      approach isn't it?,control approach,approach control
50,813,0:44:00,Jamie,yeah that's the yeah and you design it in such a way that that's a ,design way,design way
51,814,0:44:00,Jamie,reasonably comfortable position and if you don't put it in that position it ,reasonably comfortable position put position,position comfortable put
52,815,0:44:00,Jamie,doesn't work,doe work,doe work
53,816,0:44:00,Jamie,it’d be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it works,nice though naturally pick work,pick naturally nice
83,817,0:44:00,Tom,yeah but that's you can do the two together can you?,two together,together two
54,818,0:44:00,Jamie,yeah we could have a look,could look,could look
819,819,0:44:00,AJ,the other thing to to think about is in  almost all cases when I look at pens ,thing almost case look pen,pen thing case
820,820,0:44:00,AJ,the apart from re wired sort of micropens the th  tip is actually the ,apart wired sort micropens th tip actually,tip sort wired
821,821,0:45:00,AJ,narrowest part of the product whereas in what we're looking at it could ,narrowest part product whereas looking could,part narrowest product
822,822,0:45:00,AJ,actually be as wide or wider ,actually wide wider,wide wider actually
55,825,0:45:00,Charles,so its more like a paintbrush isn't it? like a DIY paintbrush,paintbrush diy paintbrush,paintbrush diy
99,827,0:45:00,Tony,it’s more like a roller like a roller yeah,roller roller,roller
830,830,0:45:00,AJ,if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that ,connected one side,connected side one
831,831,0:45:00,AJ,or a  it would be here the print head you could have then going to ,would print head could going,print head could
835,835,0:45:00,AJ,it would have flexibility because of the metal on which it's hinged if you ,would flexibility metal hinged,flexibility hinged metal
100,837,0:45:00,Tony,yeah I think      actually I wonder if you intuitively know how to use a ,actually wonder intuitively know use,intuitively know actually
101,838,0:45:00,Tony,roller because you're older than eleven and      intuitive if you've never seen ,roller older eleven intuitive never seen,eleven roller intuitive
55,840,0:45:00,Jamie,my two year old rolls paints,two year old roll paint,roll year paint
56,842,0:46:00,Jamie,OK I’ll shut up,ok shut,shut ok
57,844,0:46:00,Jamie,very liberal household but I think it could be the pen I mean it could be we ,liberal household could pen mean could,liberal pen household
58,845,0:46:00,Jamie,could shape it so it does make it like a finer tip,could shape doe make finer tip,shape finer tip
846,846,0:46:00,AJ,yeah but there's an inherent size issue with holding it this way isn't there,inherent size issue holding way,size issue holding
849,849,0:46:00,AJ,because you're not going to have you you you used to have these pens ,going used pen,pen going used
850,850,0:46:00,AJ,that were  ginormous and it had lots of different pens inside it ,ginormous lot different pen inside,lot inside pen
853,853,0:46:00,AJ, yeah and they're all like this round and it made it really difficult to write ,round made really difficult write,round write difficult
854,854,0:46:00,AJ,with  at the right angle so I think there is an issue about how big or how ,right angle issue big,angle big issue
102,858,0:46:00,Tony,you might not hold it     ,might hold,hold might
103,862,0:46:00,Tony,yeah      I think that's worth considering it actually,worth considering actually,worth actually considering
56,864,0:47:00,Charles,sorry what’s that Chris?,sorry chris,chris sorry
865,865,0:47:00,AJ,the not having it in a pen shape the not holding it like a pen but actually ,pen shape holding pen actually,pen shape holding

84,867,0:47:00,Tom,yeah there are two there are two sides to this I think either you want to ,two two side either want,side either two
85,868,0:47:00,Tom,teach children to hold a pen properly ,teach child hold pen properly,properly pen child
57,871,0:47:00,Charles,if you wanted to do that you'd give them a     ,wanted give,give wanted
86,873,0:47:00,Tom,yeah but you've got to be taught how to hold a pen,got taught hold pen,taught hold pen
28,876,0:47:00,Sarah,a lot better as      write like this as well,lot better write well,lot write better

896,896,0:48:00,AJ,its mainly really for fun really I think erm,mainly really fun really erm,erm fun mainly
58,897,0:48:00,Charles,because if you want to teach a child something about pens you'd give ,want teach child something pen give,teach pen child
59,898,0:48:00,Charles,them a pen wouldn't you,pen would,pen would
88,900,0:48:00,Tom,no well it depends it  could be fun it could teach you something,well depends could fun could teach something,teach fun depends
902,902,0:48:00,AJ,an added bonus I suppose,added bonus suppose,added bonus suppose
104,903,0:48:00,Tony,it could teach you something else its going to be quite a fat lump probably ,could teach something else going quite fat lump probably,lump teach fat
105,904,0:48:00,Tony,so it’s not going to be that kind of pen that you use in future,going kind pen use future,pen kind future
106,906,0:48:00,Tony,so it doesn't feel much like a pen,doe feel much pen,doe feel pen
60,907,0:48:00,Jamie,you know it could I think it could be more of a decorator’s thing you know ,know could could decorator thing know,decorator thing could

107,916,0:48:00,Tony,no you'd need more batteries,need battery,battery need
65,918,0:48:00,Jamie,its more of sort of decorative kind of features ,sort decorative kind feature,decorative feature kind
66,920,0:49:00,Jamie,things like that you know,thing know,thing know
89,921,0:49:00,Tom,there’s another degree of freedom to this thing if you go fast it will be a ,another degree freedom thing go fast,freedom fast thing
90,922,0:49:00,Tom,paler colour if you go slowly it will be darker wont it?,paler colour go slowly darker wont,slowly wont colour
108,924,0:49:00,Tony,yeah if you go fast well maybe  if you go fast if there's no feedback from ,go fast well maybe go fast feedback,fast feedback go
109,925,0:49:00,Tony,the paper it doesn’t matter how fast its going ,paper doe matter fast going,matter paper doe
110,927,0:49:00,Tony,then it might produce gaps but it might produce gaps in places of,might produce gap might produce gap place,gap produce place
91,930,0:49:00,Tom, the thing  would be cool,thing would cool,cool thing would
92,935,0:49:00,Tom,if you drive it faster,drive faster,drive faster
111,940,0:49:00,Tony,that's what you'll end up with but you won’t end up with a long ,end end long,end long
112,941,0:49:00,Tony,smooth line that's faint        definitely gaps in it head on all the ,smooth line faint definitely gap head,line gap smooth
113,942,0:49:00,Tony,time you don't have the head on ,time head,head time
93,944,0:49:00,Tom,yeah you could turn it off off and on very fast couldn't we ,could turn fast could,fast turn could
67,945,0:49:00,Jamie,well we’ll look at that on Monday,well look monday,monday look well
94,948,0:50:00,Tom,  alright yeah yeah I'm just wondering about the just for the ,alright wondering,alright wondering
95,949,0:50:00,Tom,    it is probably off off topic though so for the usefulness er ,probably topic though usefulness er,topic usefulness er
96,950,0:50:00,Tom,well i'm just i'm just trying to think about what what the pen does ,well trying pen doe,doe pen trying
97,951,0:50:00,Tom,really if it’s if it's a if its fun     its got to do ,really fun got,fun got really
952,952,0:50:00,AJ,sort of a wider range of features,sort wider range feature,feature range sort
98,956,0:50:00,Tom,features      somehow,feature somehow,feature somehow
114,957,0:50:00,Tony,I think it might self regulate I think people might visit around how does it ,might self regulate people might visit around doe,regulate people visit
115,960,0:50:00,Tony,or they use it more slowly I think that's ,use slowly,slowly use
116,962,0:50:00,Tony,probably what happens,probably happens,happens probably
963,963,0:50:00,AJ,but I'm thinking it will it will be more fun if you can get something you ,thinking fun get something,fun thinking get
964,964,0:50:00,AJ,know if you can get ,know get,get know
965,965,0:50:00,AJ,a faint line or ,faint line,faint line

972,972,0:50:00,AJ,you had a drawing there that you did was that for any particular purpose ?,drawing wa particular purpose,drawing wa purpose
32,974,0:51:00,Robert,this is kind of backtracking a bit but in a similar vein to this I’ve seen a ,kind backtracking bit similar vein seen,similar kind backtracking
33,975,0:51:00,Robert,pen that somebody's created where its actually got this kind of loop in it so ,pen somebody created actually got kind loop,kind loop pen
34,976,0:51:00,Robert,that if you hold it with your index finger actually through this ,hold index finger actually,index finger hold
35,980,0:51:00,Robert,it supports the rest of your hand ,support rest hand,hand rest support
36,982,0:51:00,Robert,but it’s another instance of kind of,another instance kind,instance kind another
983,983,0:51:00,AJ,so it’s you you almost wear it like a glove?,almost wear glove,glove wear almost
37,984,0:51:00,Robert,yeah or like a sort of ring on your finger with the pen ,sort ring finger pen,finger pen ring
38,985,0:51:00,Robert,attached to it but it forces you to hold it in a very specific way,attached force hold specific way,specific hold attached
100,986,0:51:00,Tom,um that's intriguing sort of like a like a could be like a finger puppet ,intriguing sort could finger puppet,puppet intriguing sort
30,988,0:51:00,Sarah,yeah cos wearing it like a finger puppet – the feel of it might be fun,co wearing finger puppet feel might fun,puppet fun wearing
101,989,0:51:00,Tom,exactly so you can make you can make the footprints ,exactly make make footprint,make footprint exactly
39,990,0:51:00,Robert,I I think I think the sort of design not very good at     ,sort design good,design good sort
992,992,0:51:00,AJ,that would also tie in quite well the sort of cyber view of having a pack on ,would also tie quite well sort cyber view pack,cyber pack view
995,995,0:51:00,AJ,or sort of cyber arm isn't it,sort cyber arm,arm cyber sort
60,999,0:52:00,Charles,thermal print head,thermal print head,head print thermal
102,1000,0:52:00,Tom,It’s like the evil emperor from star wars ,evil emperor star war,emperor evil star
103,1002,0:52:00,Tom,lightning coming out of his  nose ,lightning coming nose,coming lightning nose
1005,1005,0:52:00,AJ,the final thing I wanted to consider briefly before we move onto the next ,final thing wanted consider briefly move onto next,thing move briefly
1006,1006,0:52:00,AJ,part is the issue of left and right handedness how we're going to resolve ,part issue left right handedness going resolve,handedness issue resolve
61,1008,0:52:00,Charles,teach people to be right handed that's what it needs to do,teach people right handed need,people handed teach
62,1010,0:52:00,Charles,that's what they used to do in the nineteen fifties,used nineteen fifty,fifty nineteen used
104,1011,0:52:00,Tom,tie the left hand behind their back,tie left hand behind back,left hand back
1015,1015,0:52:00,AJ,hit them with a cane I was not from that generation obviously,hit cane wa generation obviously,hit cane generation
68,1016,0:52:00,Jamie,well I guess ,well guess,guess well
1017,1017,0:52:00,AJ,can you turn the print head round? or ,turn print head round,head print round
69,1018,0:52:00,Jamie,it doesn't matter because as long as you've got as long as you've got ,doe matter long got long got,long doe matter
70,1019,0:52:00,Jamie,features that can be either mirrored features the same on each side ,feature either mirrored feature side,feature side mirrored
71,1021,0:52:00,Jamie,you've got them all like that you've got some area to work with and then ,got got area work,area work got
72,1022,0:52:00,Jamie,you have to keep the area of the mirror image ,keep area mirror image,area image mirror
105,1024,0:53:00,Tom, quite good ,quite good,good quite
1026,1026,0:53:00,AJ,in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it isn't even a pen ,fact way fact even pen,fact pen even
1027,1027,0:53:00,AJ,because a pen you you'll always learn to write from left to right whether ,pen always learn write left right whether,learn pen write
1028,1028,0:53:00,AJ,you're left handed or right handed so actually what you end up doing is ,left handed right handed actually end,handed left end
1029,1029,0:53:00,AJ,left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem ,left handed people smudge work problem,smudge people handed
1030,1030,0:53:00,AJ,but actually with this you're dragging it you're not pushing it are you ,actually dragging pushing,dragging pushing actually
1031,1031,0:53:00,AJ,most people will drag it,people drag,drag people
31,1032,0:53:00,Sarah,mostly dragging it,mostly dragging,dragging mostly
1033,1033,0:53:00,AJ,  because you were wired to drag it,wired drag,drag wired
73,1036,0:53:00,Jamie,that's an interesting point,interesting point,interesting point
1037,1037,0:53:00,AJ,  so you want a design then to sort of force people to drag it which is ,want design sort force people drag,sort force design
1038,1038,0:53:00,AJ,not something you do with a marker pen ,something marker pen,marker pen something
32,1039,0:53:00,Sarah,      you draw a line when you drag      ,draw line drag,drag draw line
1040,1040,0:53:00,AJ,generally  you might do with a marker pen ,generally might marker pen,generally marker pen
1045,1045,0:53:00,AJ,with a marker pen you tend to drag yeah but what I'm saying is the ,marker pen tend drag saying,pen drag marker
1046,1046,0:53:00,AJ,analogy of teaching people to write is not actually valid in the sense that ,analogy teaching people write actually valid sense,teaching sense valid
1047,1047,0:54:00,AJ,when you're writing you're not actually dragging usually apart from if ,writing actually dragging usually apart,dragging writing usually
1048,1048,0:54:00,AJ,you're right handed,right handed,handed right
1050,1050,0:54:00,AJ,if you're  right handed  you drag if you're left handed you push,right handed drag left handed push,handed left drag
106,1051,0:54:00,Tom, if you're right handed ,right handed,handed right
117,1052,0:54:00,Tony,so do they do a left handed version of this,left handed version,handed left version
40,1053,0:54:00,Robert,yes they do you see them in the shop,see shop,shop see
118,1055,0:54:00,Tony,that’s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader ,interesting co commercially lost would loss leader,commercially interesting lost
107,1057,0:54:00,Tom,well it must it must cost twice as much,well must must cost twice much,cost twice must
41,1060,0:54:00,Robert, six cups of tea later ,six cup tea later,cup tea later
108,1061,0:54:00,Tom,its gonna cost twice as much,gonna cost twice much,cost gonna much
63,1063,0:54:00,Charles,     but schools or something schools must buy two sets,school something school must buy two set,school set buy
109,1064,0:54:00,Tom,yeah its not worth  its not really for schools,worth really school,school worth really
1065,1065,0:54:00,AJ,well they had that in my school when I was in primary school everybody ,well school wa primary school everybody,school wa primary
1066,1066,0:54:00,AJ,had a red fountain pen and I had a special green fountain pen because I ,red fountain pen special green fountain pen,pen fountain red
1067,1067,0:54:00,AJ,was left handed,wa left handed,handed left wa
119,1070,0:55:00,Tony,just before we move on to it   to do with mechanics     ,move mechanic,mechanic move
120,1072,0:55:00,Tony,erm protecting the print head which I haven't really thought very much ,erm protecting print head really thought much,protecting print erm
121,1073,0:55:00,Tony,about but as it it might be a nuisance or bad thing to have the print head ,might nuisance bad thing print head,print thing bad
122,1074,0:55:00,Tony,projecting down out of the bottom of this most of the time,projecting bottom time,bottom projecting time
123,1076,0:55:00,Tony,because it may catch on things like the edge of the table or something like ,may catch thing edge table something,table thing catch
124,1079,0:55:00,Tony,and so perhaps there is something else a rounded lump or something ,perhaps something else rounded lump something,rounded lump perhaps
125,1080,0:55:00,Tony,as it approaches the page causes the print head to come down,approach page cause print head come,page print approach
126,1084,0:55:00,Tony,which may carriage  be sprung  also,may carriage sprung also,carriage sprung also
74,1085,0:55:00,Jamie,like a see saw,see saw,saw see
75,1087,0:55:00,Jamie,like a   nodding birds yeah,nodding bird,bird nodding
110,1090,0:55:00,Tom,the other sort of side to this is that could you not what you do is  very  ,sort side could,side sort could
111,1094,0:56:00,Tom,if you have your printing head   and you've got you've got your spring ,printing head got got spring,spring head printing
112,1095,0:56:00,Tom,like that     and you've got    a switch or something here    ,got switch something,switch got something
113,1096,0:56:00,Tom,and you've got    a case there   and then when you you can only ,got case,case got
114,1097,0:56:00,Tom,push this and then when you push this up so that all the faces are touching ,push push face touching,push face touching
115,1098,0:56:00,Tom,that's when the switch goes,switch go,switch go
116,1100,0:56:00,Tom,erm so you get so so what this is is is maybe this isn't susceptible ,erm get maybe susceptible,erm susceptible get
117,1101,0:56:00,Tom,to knocks and things because its on a sp spring,knock thing sp spring,knock sp spring
127,1102,0:56:00,Tony,yeah and you get protected by a case,get protected case,case protected get
1103,1103,0:56:00,AJ,but the other thing is the opposite of this being here and these two things ,thing opposite two thing,thing opposite two
1104,1104,0:57:00,AJ,being on springs so that when these get pushed back,spring get pushed back,back spring pushed
1106,1106,0:57:00,AJ,they'll spring back and then they'll switch on the ,spring back switch,back spring switch
118,1107,0:57:00,Tom,that's true that works as well,true work well,true work well
1108,1108,0:57:00,AJ, that works even better cos it’s not leaking  its protected then,work even better co leaking protected,leaking work protected
33,1116,0:57:00,Sarah, a print head ,print head,head print
64,1117,0:57:00,Charles,yeah do you need to stop the print head going sideways cos you want it to ,need print head going sideways co want,sideways print head
65,1118,0:57:00,Charles,travel     forwards when its going that direction?,travel forward going direction,direction forward travel
1119,1119,0:57:00,AJ,yeah you don't want people to go that that that's an interesting point,want people go interesting point,point people interesting
66,1120,0:57:00,Charles,put wheels on the side to make it,put wheel side make,make put side
128,1121,0:57:00,Tony,I I don't think there might not be a problem with that in fact it might be ,might problem fact might,fact problem might
129,1122,0:57:00,Tony,something that they might want to do to produce interesting effects      ,something might want produce interesting effect,produce effect interesting
130,1123,0:57:00,Tony,distorted smiley faces,distorted smiley face,distorted face smiley
131,1125,0:57:00,Tony,and I think we might get away with that,might get away,away get might
1127,1127,0:57:00,AJ,but what if  what if  a child held the pen can I just borrow that,child held pen borrow,borrow child held
1129,1129,0:58:00,AJ,rather than  holding it width ways so this is across the pen ,rather holding width way across pen,pen width holding
1132,1132,0:58:00,AJ,thinking of holding it that way ,thinking holding way,holding thinking way
34,1133,0:58:00,Sarah,providing just enough pressure,providing enough pressure,pressure providing enough
132,1134,0:58:00,Tony,providing      probably be alright,providing probably alright,alright providing probably
119,1137,0:58:00,Tom,it is sort of like a its like a calligraphy pen isn't it if you erm,sort calligraphy pen erm,calligraphy erm pen
120,1139,0:58:00,Tom,because you get thick you get thick and thin ,get thick get thick thin,thick thin get
121,1141,0:58:00,Tom,because you get      the edge,get edge,edge get
1142,1142,0:58:00,AJ,yeah yeah shall we move onto the next bit,shall move onto next bit,move bit next
1144,1144,0:58:00,AJ,well we've got a sketch of it,well got sketch,sketch got well
1146,1146,0:58:00,AJ,well how do you want me to write it down,well want write,write want well
133,1147,0:58:00,Tony,erm I could write it down but I couldn't think of the words to explain it,erm could write could word explain,word explain write
134,1149,0:58:00,Tony,er sort of –,er sort,er sort
135,1151,0:58:00,Tony,that business of withdrawing the print head when it’s not in use or ,business withdrawing print head use,print business head
122,1153,0:58:00,Tom,well yeah well it's a sheath isn't it that's the word you said wasn't it a ,well well sheath word said wa,wa word sheath
136,1157,0:58:00,Tony, or it could be deployed  on contact or something,could deployed contact something,contact deployed could
1163,1163,0:59:00,AJ,OK it is fundamental the other thing that I'm now going to look at is     two ,ok fundamental thing going look two,thing fundamental look
1164,1164,0:59:00,AJ,two problems one is over pressurising the print head on the paper or abuse ,two problem one pressurising print head paper abuse,print paper problem
1165,1165,0:59:00,AJ,of the pen so somebody could go like that ,pen somebody could go,pen could go
1167,1167,0:59:00,AJ,and that will probably break it and ,probably break,break probably
123,1168,0:59:00,Tom,the sheath doesn't fix that does it er no the sheath doesn't fix that,sheath doe fix doe er sheath doe fix,doe sheath fix
124,1170,0:59:00,Tom,you go like that you hit the printer,go hit printer,hit printer go
125,1172,0:59:00,Tom,whereas the other way round,whereas way round,round way whereas
137,1173,0:59:00,Tony,well the sheath      protect that isn't it    so,well sheath protect,protect sheath well
67,1174,0:59:00,Charles,the sheaths so spring both      and the things happen,sheath spring thing happen,happen sheath spring
138,1175,0:59:00,Tony,yeah so expect there's more travel if you smash there,expect travel smash,expect smash travel
126,1176,0:59:00,Tom,yeah that means you can’t move both yeah yeah that's right yeah so I its ,mean cannot move right,move cannot mean
127,1177,1:00:00,Tom,what AJ suggested that this moves back ,aj suggested move back,aj back move
128,1179,1:00:00,Tom,to to start to  as a switch whereas the alternative is for that to move back,start switch whereas alternative move back,switch move alternative
1180,1180,1:00:00,AJ,well I suppose you could design it such a way as it only goes,well suppose could design way go,suppose design go
1182,1182,1:00:00,AJ, at a certain  speed back so if you went if you just went like that it would ,certain speed back went went would,speed back went
1183,1183,1:00:00,AJ,go back quite ,go back quite,back go quite
1185,1185,1:00:00,AJ,slowly but if too quickly,slowly quickly,quickly slowly
129,1186,1:00:00,Tom,you you could have them both moving back and you could have you could ,could moving back could could,back moving could
130,1187,1:00:00,Tom,balance springs and things like that,balance spring thing,balance spring thing
68,1188,1:00:00,Charles,you could hold this this back,could hold back,back hold could
69,1190,1:00:00,Charles,if that thing’s on a spring and that's on a      ,thing spring,spring thing
70,1192,1:00:00,Charles,of some sort which could be quite simple,sort could quite simple,sort simple could
71,1195,1:00:00,Charles,this this that’s with em that only needs to be a syringe and then ,em need syringe,em syringe need
72,1197,1:00:00,Charles,and if you bang it down its effectively solid,bang effectively solid,bang effectively solid
1199,1199,1:01:00,AJ,leaking syringe,leaking syringe,leaking syringe
131,1200,1:01:00,Tom,cheap syringe,cheap syringe,cheap syringe
1201,1201,1:01:00,AJ,syringe I can spell that,syringe spell,spell syringe

1206,1206,1:01:00,AJ,yeah its going well isn't it      so its all right,going well right,going right well
1209,1209,1:01:00,AJ,any other ways in which we could try I mean we could put a cap over it ,way could mean could put cap,put cap mean
42,1212,1:01:00,Robert,that's way too low tech for this,way low tech,low tech way
35,1216,1:01:00,Sarah,     that will protect it but it still      isn't it?,protect still,protect still
76,1219,1:01:00,Jamie,what about a cap like a spring loaded cap,cap spring loaded cap,cap loaded spring
77,1221,1:01:00,Jamie,that comes out of the way,come way,come way
36,1226,1:01:00,Sarah,then it couldn't get lost could it?,could get lost could,lost could get
140,1227,1:01:00,Tony,  it could also turn off the comforting hum ,could also turn comforting hum,hum turn comforting
141,1229,1:02:00,Tony,when you put the cap back on,put cap back,back cap put
37,1231,1:02:00,Sarah,I quite like the idea of a comforting hum!,quite idea comforting hum,comforting hum idea
1232,1232,1:02:00,AJ,a comforting hum,comforting hum,comforting hum

1240,1240,1:02:00,AJ,its going to get completely lost in translation,going get completely lost translation,lost translation completely
132,1241,1:02:00,Tom,digerydoo blimey,digerydoo blimey,blimey digerydoo
1244,1244,1:02:00,AJ,who's this rolf harris?,rolf harris,harris rolf
1246,1246,1:02:00,AJ,the cap is quite interesting though because if it hinges that way it will ,cap quite interesting though hinge way,interesting cap hinge
1247,1247,1:02:00,AJ,make people much more likely to to drag it across there if it’s clear ,make people much likely drag across clear,people make drag
78,1249,1:02:00,Jamie,yeah but you can still see things or if you had not just an activation button ,still see thing activation button,thing activation button
79,1250,1:02:00,Jamie,not an activation button but a button that made the print head come out ,activation button button made print head come,button made print
142,1253,1:02:00,Tony,yeah that's what I was thinking,wa thinking,thinking wa
80,1254,1:02:00,Jamie,a non a non clickable pen so you had to you know obviously not up there,non non clickable pen know obviously,pen clickable obviously
1257,1257,1:03:00,AJ,if you if you go like that it would sort of go out a little bit and then if you ,go would sort go little bit,sort bit little
1258,1258,1:03:00,AJ,push it up it would go out more,push would go,push go would
81,1259,1:03:00,Jamie,I mean you can still damage it,mean still damage,damage mean still
1260,1260,1:03:00,AJ,so it's a it's a dead man’s handle for a pen basically,dead man handle pen basically,man handle basically
143,1262,1:03:00,Tony,you could have a little slider on it could it could do this kind of thing round,could little slider could could kind thing round,thing slider kind
144,1265,1:03:00,Tony,one way or the other you could have sort of     ,one way could sort,sort could one
133,1266,1:03:00,Tom,yeah yeah and then and then you coul  it could just be sprung and then ,coul could sprung,coul sprung could
134,1267,1:03:00,Tom,when you put it down its held open by     ,put held open,held open put
82,1268,1:03:00,Jamie,and then any pressure on the tip,pressure tip,pressure tip
39,1272,1:03:00,Sarah,you're not going to be using it for hours on end are you it's for little ,going using hour end little,hour end little
145,1275,1:03:00,Tony,I would say long car journeys though,would say long car journey though,long car journey
83,1276,1:03:00,Jamie,you could have a      and that open up ,could open,open could
40,1277,1:03:00,Sarah,a little bit annoying on long car journeys  ,little bit annoying long car journey,journey car annoying
84,1279,1:03:00,Jamie,you could have a cap that goes like that and then you could also have the ,could cap go could also,cap also could
85,1280,1:04:00,Jamie,same spring here that any force by a certain amount would force the cap to ,spring force certain amount would force cap,force spring cap
86,1283,1:04:00,Jamie,a double action cap so you      button but it's got an override of pressure ,double action cap button got override pressure,override double action
87,1284,1:04:00,Jamie,of a certain force ,certain force,force certain
135,1287,1:04:00,Tom,I'm thinking of something a bit like the flap on a video tape,thinking something bit flap video tape,thinking video bit
1289,1289,1:04:00,AJ,uh huh what the flap?,huh flap,flap huh
146,1291,1:04:00,Tony,like a garage door type of thing,garage door type thing,door garage thing
136,1292,1:04:00,Tom,yeah push the button then it goes open,push button go open,button push open
137,1294,1:04:00,Tom,but that's probably overly complicated,probably overly complicated,complicated overly probably
43,1295,1:04:00,Robert,garage door well it could be a roller,garage door well could roller,roller garage door
138,1296,1:04:00,Tom,a roller door ,roller door,door roller
139,1299,1:04:00,Tom,yeah that's pretty much yeah,pretty much,pretty much
88,1300,1:04:00,Jamie,yeah a button here that    there's a slider that opens the pen but then ,button slider open pen,button open pen
89,1301,1:04:00,Jamie,regardless of whether you've got the button pressed down or not you press ,regardless whether got button pressed press,pressed press button
90,1302,1:05:00,Jamie,hard and it comes back down,hard come back,back hard come
91,1305,1:05:00,Jamie,so it doesn't matter if you drag it it'll just ,doe matter drag,doe drag matter
1307,1307,1:05:00,AJ,or you just keep that button pressed but ,keep button pressed,button pressed keep
92,1308,1:05:00,Jamie,yeah if you're very sort of cover that comes down,sort cover come,cover sort come
1309,1309,1:05:00,AJ,are you just whacking this pen there,whacking pen,pen whacking
93,1310,1:05:00,Jamie,it's got a cap on,got cap,cap got
94,1314,1:05:00,Jamie,very expensive budget this project,expensive budget project,budget expensive project
95,1316,1:05:00,Jamie,how much did that pen cost,much pen cost,cost pen much
44,1317,1:05:00,Robert,well about five pence or something,well five penny something,penny five something
96,1324,1:05:00,Jamie,I assume it has a cover that comes on as well,assume ha cover come well,ha cover assume
97,1329,1:05:00,Jamie,so one one pence two pence six pence,one one penny two penny six penny,penny one six
98,1331,1:06:00,Jamie,twenty pence,twenty penny,penny twenty
74,1332,1:06:00,Charles,you could put a time delay on it that's a good way of protecting it,could put time delay good way protecting,delay good time
75,1334,1:06:00,Charles,you could say it has to be in contact with the paper for a second  and then ,could say ha contact paper second,paper ha contact
76,1335,1:06:00,Charles,the thing will deployed ,thing deployed,deployed thing
99,1338,1:06:00,Jamie,and that way it’s protected from being banged,way protected banged,banged protected way
1341,1341,1:06:00,AJ,is there is there an issue anyway guys with there being or having to be ,issue anyway guy,guy issue anyway
1342,1342,1:06:00,AJ,or a benefit by having like a stand by mode so its either completely ,benefit stand mode either completely,mode stand benefit
1343,1343,1:06:00,AJ,switched off with or without the cap on it or there's like a stand by mode,switched without cap stand mode,switched stand cap
1344,1344,1:06:00,AJ,where its sort of semi warm but its ready for action quickly,sort semi warm ready action quickly,sort ready action
147,1345,1:06:00,Tony,it has a home so a docking station,ha home docking station,docking ha home
1346,1346,1:06:00,AJ,yeah nice one,nice one,nice one
148,1347,1:06:00,Tony,we could charge it in there as well plus it might be over budget but let's not ,could charge well plus might budget let u,charge budget plus
1349,1349,1:06:00,AJ,yeah so a docking station what would the docking station look like ,docking station would docking station look,docking station look
149,1351,1:06:00,Tony,well it would just be a cradle it would just be somewhere for it to live ,well would cradle would somewhere live,live cradle somewhere
150,1352,1:06:00,Tony,when you're not using it like a little protector,using little protector,protector little using
45,1356,1:07:00,Robert,a quill that means it's not something that you could put in your pencil case,quill mean something could put pencil case,put pencil quill
1359,1359,1:07:00,AJ,would it be  you're not supposed to be negative     ,would supposed negative,negative supposed would
1361,1361,1:07:00,AJ,well I think there's an issue actually there as well with children sometimes ,well issue actually well child sometimes,child issue actually
1362,1362,1:07:00,AJ,using lots of types of pens at the same time if you had written ,using lot type pen time written,type time lot
1363,1363,1:07:00,AJ,something or smudged something with some other type of pen or even ,something smudged something type pen even,smudged type pen
1366,1366,1:07:00,AJ,pencil or a crayon or something like that and then you used this on the ,pencil crayon something used,crayon pencil something
1367,1367,1:07:00,AJ,same paper would it make the print head dirty and would there need to be ,paper would make print head dirty would need,head make print
1368,1368,1:07:00,AJ,some way of cleaning the print head potentially or would it be good to ,way cleaning print head potentially would good,print potentially cleaning
1369,1369,1:07:00,AJ,have some way of cleaning the print head?,way cleaning print head,cleaning head print
1371,1371,1:07:00,AJ,like we could have a cap on it that actually sort of goes past it,could cap actually sort go past,past sort cap
100,1372,1:07:00,Jamie,is there any danger if you got ink from another pen or paint can it short ,danger got ink another pen paint short,paint ink pen
140,1375,1:08:00,Tom,it won't short it but it might burn into the head so,short might burn head,burn head short
151,1376,1:08:00,Tony,the good thing you could clean this you can get ,good thing could clean get,good thing clean
141,1377,1:08:00,Tom,a crayon would be all right because that would melt,crayon would right would melt,crayon melt right
1381,1381,1:08:00,AJ,that's alright no problem,alright problem,alright problem
152,1384,1:08:00,Tony,you can clean it but I’ve  got a way of cleaning it with a  knife ,clean got way cleaning knife,knife clean cleaning
142,1385,1:08:00,Tom,but paint would be a problem wouldn't it you'd imagine that ,paint would problem would imagine,imagine paint problem
153,1386,1:08:00,Tony,you could clean it off but you couldn't get the kids to do it,could clean could get kid,clean kid could
154,1388,1:08:00,Tony,unless you er unless you did it automatically,unless er unless automatically,automatically er unless
101,1389,1:08:00,Jamie,I mean if you leave the top off that for twenty minutes it dries out,mean leave top twenty minute dry,top twenty dry
102,1392,1:08:00,Jamie,yes we could just up the age limit it's not a problem,could age limit problem,age problem limit
1393,1393,1:08:00,AJ,do we want to did you write cleaning down,want write cleaning,cleaning write want
103,1395,1:09:00,Jamie,OK want to do some more detail a bit more mechanism,ok want detail bit mechanism,mechanism bit detail
1396,1396,1:09:00,AJ,have we got enough on this the last one here exactly when     ,got enough last one exactly,last got enough
104,1397,1:09:00,Jamie,well we we've got various things haven't we? we just have to contact it,well got various thing contact,thing contact various
105,1399,1:09:00,Jamie,pressure contacts or its got to be got to be depressed,pressure contact got got depressed,contact depressed pressure
106,1401,1:09:00,Jamie,imagine you have piece of metal,imagine piece metal,imagine metal piece
107,1403,1:09:00,Jamie,spring switch,spring switch,spring switch
1404,1404,1:09:00,AJ,is there a     could you measure I'm thinking of for example if a child ,could measure thinking example child,measure thinking child
1405,1405,1:09:00,AJ,decides to try to write on his clothes or on their skin or whatever,decides write clothes skin whatever,skin clothes decides
1407,1407,1:09:00,AJ,erm it may not be such a good idea ,erm may good idea,erm good idea
1409,1409,1:09:00,AJ,is there a way we could,way could,could way
1411,1411,1:09:00,AJ,is there a way that you could,way could,could way
1413,1413,1:09:00,AJ,erm potentially feedback how quick the how quick the head cools down if ,erm potentially feedback quick quick head cool,quick potentially cool
1414,1414,1:11:00,AJ,its on the actual paper its supposed to be on versus if it was on some ,actual paper supposed versus wa,versus supposed actual
1415,1415,1:11:00,AJ,different media sort of ,different medium sort,medium sort different
155,1416,1:11:00,Tony,I think that's I think that's really for Monday,really monday,monday really
143,1421,1:11:00,Tom,how hot does it get,hot doe get,doe hot get
156,1424,1:11:00,Tony,err    it does get quite hot well ,err doe get quite hot well,hot doe err
157,1426,1:11:00,Tony,the tiny dots can get quite hot,tiny dot get quite hot,hot dot tiny
158,1428,1:11:00,Tony,and there's next to no thermal lapse so they cold again very quickly,next thermal lapse cold quickly,quickly thermal cold
144,1431,1:11:00,Tom,if you wear it on your skin it would just be       ,wear skin would,skin wear would
159,1433,1:11:00,Tony,we need to test this but I ,need test,test need
145,1435,1:11:00,Tom,anyone volunteer?,anyone volunteer,volunteer anyone
108,1437,1:11:00,Jamie,I think it’s one that plays with the concept,one play concept,concept play one
1443,1443,1:11:00,AJ,but having said sorry Tony ,said sorry tony,tony said sorry
160,1444,1:11:00,Tony,well there's potential for a safety issue but at the moment I think there ,well potential safety issue moment,safety potential issue
161,1445,1:11:00,Tony,might not be one we need to find out,might one need find,find might need
162,1447,1:11:00,Tony,erm but I don't think we should let that cloud what we're doing here,erm let cloud,cloud erm let
163,1449,1:11:00,Tony,but where you're going trying to detect a cooling rate from the media ,going trying detect cooling rate medium,cooling rate detect
164,1450,1:11:00,Tony,that you've been in contact with can be a very hard thing to do but ,contact hard thing,contact hard thing
165,1451,1:11:00,Tony,detecting the media or detecting that you're on some kind of media ,detecting medium detecting kind medium,detecting medium kind
166,1453,1:11:00,Tony,or holding station or something cos it could be sold as it could be a thing ,holding station something co could sold could thing,station sold thing
167,1454,1:11:00,Tony,you put your special media on or ,put special medium,medium put special
168,1457,1:11:00,Tony,and we could either detect that or we could look for translucent dots ,could either detect could look translucent dot,dot translucent detect
169,1458,1:11:00,Tony,buried in the media or something,buried medium something,buried medium something
146,1459,1:11:00,Tom,or you could they you could a they could be like er beads switches you can ,could could could er bead switch,bead switch er
147,1460,1:11:00,Tom,only write on a magnetic plate isn't it,write magnetic plate,magnetic plate write
170,1461,1:11:00,Tony,yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,could looking signal,signal could looking
171,1463,1:11:00,Tony,or detecting a change     ,detecting change,change detecting
172,1465,1:11:00,Tony, yeah its more systemy I guess beyond the actual pen you could ,systemy guess beyond actual pen could,pen systemy actual
173,1466,1:12:00,Tony,imagine all sorts of systems where,imagine sort system,imagine sort system
148,1468,1:12:00,Tom,you're tied you're tied to the media anyway so it’s not really,tied tied medium anyway really,tied medium anyway
174,1469,1:12:00,Tony,erm yeah you're probably not constrained because you unless you are ,erm probably constrained unless,constrained erm probably
175,1470,1:12:00,Tony,detecting something special about the media which you might want to do ,detecting something special medium might want,special detecting medium
176,1472,1:12:00,Tony,the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or ,effect medium would work thermal medium,medium thermal effect
177,1477,1:12:00,Tony,fax machines,fax machine,fax machine
1478,1478,1:12:00,AJ,shall we move onto  sorry Jamie     ,shall move onto sorry jamie,move jamie onto
109,1479,1:12:00,Jamie,I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the ,wa going say concentrate,concentrate wa going
110,1480,1:12:00,Jamie,mechanism might look like,mechanism might look,mechanism look might
111,1482,1:12:00,Jamie,the      thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,thermal pen co spend quite lot time,lot pen thermal
1484,1484,1:12:00,AJ,so in terms of the actual mechanism we've explored some different angles ,term actual mechanism explored different angle,mechanism term actual
1485,1485,1:12:00,AJ,on that haven't we? in terms of the  you mean in terms of the spring ,term mean term spring,term spring mean
1486,1486,1:12:00,AJ,loading and things like that,loading thing,loading thing
112,1487,1:12:00,Jamie,yeah I just wondered if you wanted to organise it in some sort of more ,wondered wanted organise sort,organise sort wanted
113,1488,1:12:00,Jamie,sketches rather than what's ,sketch rather,sketch rather
178,1491,1:12:00,Tony,well do you want to try?,well want,want well
179,1493,1:12:00,Tony,does does anyone see anything very much wrong,doe doe anyone see anything much wrong,doe wrong much
1494,1494,1:13:00,AJ,yeah that's a good idea,good idea,good idea
114,1495,1:13:00,Jamie,well that's one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer ,well one idea ha ha two outer ha outer,ha outer idea
115,1496,1:13:00,Jamie,limit how far the slider can move,limit far slider move,slider limit move
116,1499,1:13:00,Jamie,that controls  there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the ,control obviously stay angle get,stay angle control
117,1500,1:13:00,Jamie,maximum angle and then if all,maximum angle,angle maximum
1502,1502,1:13:00,AJ,and then it could switch off couldn't it? if it w  if it was hitting a certain ,could switch could wa hitting certain,switch hitting wa
1503,1503,1:13:00,AJ,angle it could switch off,angle could switch,angle switch could
118,1504,1:13:00,Jamie,you'd need an additional partner mechanism    so you could switch you ,need additional partner mechanism could switch,partner mechanism additional
119,1505,1:13:00,Jamie,could have that  you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that ,could could contact top bottom,bottom contact top
120,1508,1:13:00,Jamie,and then they could stay do they really need to stay in contact well if you ,could stay really need stay contact well,stay contact need
121,1509,1:13:00,Jamie,don't press hard enough then       edge and if you go over it if you come too ,press hard enough edge go come,hard press edge
122,1510,1:13:00,Jamie,high an angle,high angle,angle high
149,1511,1:13:00,Tom,yeah you need er,need er,er need
123,1514,1:13:00,Jamie,or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,could cylinder moved slot,slot cylinder moved
124,1516,1:14:00,Jamie,so that this can move that way,move way,move way
125,1518,1:14:00,Jamie,but what you cant do is it can't the print head can’t tilt back or forward ,cant cannot print head cannot tilt back forward,head forward print
1520,1520,1:14:00,AJ,they're in a fixed position yeah,fixed position,fixed position
126,1521,1:14:00,Jamie,this this stays at a fixed angle it can move up and down,stay fixed angle move,angle fixed move
127,1523,1:14:00,Jamie,and side to side its fixed that way,side side fixed way,side fixed way
1526,1526,1:14:00,AJ,the print head relative to the pen,print head relative pen,head pen print
150,1528,1:14:00,Tom,I'm sorry I'm just thinking about I think there's probably a geometry that ,sorry thinking probably geometry,geometry thinking probably
151,1529,1:14:00,Tom,could do it with just one switch ,could one switch,switch could one
152,1532,1:14:00,Tom,that when you come too far over the pen starts moving back in and so ,come far pen start moving back,pen start back
153,1533,1:15:00,Tom,      back in and therefore the switch comes off,back therefore switch come,back switch come
154,1535,1:15:00,Tom,before it looses contact you know it depends on the shape of the case work ,loos contact know depends shape case work,loos work shape
155,1538,1:15:00,Tom,the outside bit,outside bit,bit outside
180,1539,1:15:00,Tony,yeah the thing that we did a few years ago which had a kind of sort of ,thing year ago kind sort,thing sort ago
181,1540,1:15:00,Tony,forced balanced print head we tend to do fairly wide print heads to try and ,forced balanced print head tend fairly wide print head,print head tend
182,1541,1:15:00,Tony,keep them in contact with the medium it appears a bit different less ,keep contact medium appears bit different le,le medium appears
183,1544,1:15:00,Tony,and on that we basically had a frame which brought the print head down ,basically frame brought print head,head frame basically
184,1545,1:15:00,Tony,brought the print head down,brought print head,brought head print
1552,1552,1:15:00,AJ,it’s like the old tape recorders isn't it?,old tape recorder,recorder tape old
185,1553,1:15:00,Tony,it finds its own level,find level,find level
186,1555,1:15:00,Tony,and the force is applied to this that's right the print head just like this erm,force applied right print head erm,print force applied
187,1557,1:16:00,Tony,on a carrier as well,carrier well,carrier well
1558,1558,1:16:00,AJ,could it work this way as well?,could work way well,work could way
128,1560,1:16:00,Jamie,what you always want to combine is something that when you press you ,always want combine something press,combine press always
129,1561,1:16:00,Jamie,press media so that you've made contact      circuit you over pressurise it ,press medium made contact circuit pressurise,press made circuit
130,1562,1:16:00,Jamie,and it goes past it ,go past,past go
131,1564,1:16:00,Jamie,so it doesn't work and then you've got you've got bottom out,doe work got got bottom,bottom doe work
132,1566,1:16:00,Jamie,sheath here brilliant idea and could you use these contacts and put them ,sheath brilliant idea could use contact put,put idea sheath
133,1567,1:16:00,Jamie,in 3D could be one could be one here and there we only need two in the ,could one could one need two,could need one
134,1568,1:16:00,Jamie,front and back so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie ,front back well right vertical position ie,vertical position back
135,1569,1:16:00,Jamie,actually touching paper so that it dissipates heat not press too far because ,actually touching paper dissipates heat press far,paper heat press
136,1570,1:16:00,Jamie,then it pops out the sheath and you're over pressurising it,pop sheath pressurising,pop pressurising sheath
137,1572,1:16:00,Jamie,but also something to do with the fact that these contacts if if as you say go ,also something fact contact say go,fact contact say
138,1573,1:17:00,Jamie,over an angle then you notice that central thing comes away from one side,angle notice central thing come away one side,notice thing side
139,1575,1:17:00,Jamie,you know the distances between the edge of these      ,know distance edge,distance edge know
140,1577,1:17:00,Jamie,the distance between the edges of these things and the outer casing when ,distance edge thing outer casing,outer edge casing
141,1578,1:17:00,Jamie,you're at a small angle they move a little bit when you're at a big angle ,small angle move little bit big angle,angle move bit
142,1579,1:17:00,Jamie,one sides hard up against it the other one produces a gap and so you can ,one side hard one produce gap,produce side gap
143,1582,1:17:00,Jamie,could you have that front and back as well like a sort of cross,could front back well sort cross,sort cross back
144,1584,1:17:00,Jamie,and then you have to have all four things contacted like what you said ,four thing contacted said,contacted thing four
145,1587,1:17:00,Jamie,if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance because they're ,draw draw four contact compliance,draw compliance contact
146,1588,1:17:00,Jamie,on a spring and then you've got your central four    points here this is ,spring got central four point,point spring central
147,1589,1:18:00,Jamie,going to be up then if you go in that plane,going go plane,plane go going
148,1590,1:18:00,Jamie,over an angle too much    ,angle much,angle much
156,1592,1:18:00,Tom,my arg what I was trying to say before is you could do it with one ,arg wa trying say could one,wa arg say
157,1593,1:18:00,Tom,switch if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,switch casework say casework come errm,casework errm switch
158,1594,1:18:00,Tom,    it may or may not work   if you what it does is you've ,may may work doe,doe work may
159,1595,1:18:00,Tom,got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works but then if you pivot ,got one switch back work pivot,switch work back
160,1596,1:18:00,Tom,pivot this can pivot a bit but it but it pivots more on the k  but the case ,pivot pivot bit pivot case,pivot bit case
161,1597,1:18:00,Tom,if you pivot a little bit on the c the case comes in contact and it starts to ,pivot little bit case come contact start,pivot contact bit
162,1598,1:18:00,Tom,come away,come away,away come
1599,1599,1:18:00,AJ,it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so ,could shaped,shaped could
163,1600,1:18:00,Tom,so that so that when it it doesn't actually ,doe actually,doe actually
164,1602,1:18:00,Tom,when it doesn't actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that ,doe actually come away guaranteed er,doe guaranteed er
165,1603,1:19:00,Tom,its still on the paper,still paper,paper still
166,1605,1:19:00,Tom,sorry that's not really right explaining,sorry really right explaining,explaining really right
188,1606,1:19:00,Tony,don't we have to very much casework,much casework,casework much
167,1607,1:19:00,Tom,all I'm saying is is is that the if the amount of movement is here,saying amount movement,amount movement saying
168,1608,1:19:00,Tom,is bigger than     the amount of movement that the case ,bigger amount movement case,amount bigger case
169,1609,1:19:00,Tom,will allow then sort of  I'm not really sure that you need you need the case ,allow sort really sure need need case,sort case need
170,1610,1:19:00,Tom,at all its just its just sort of I'm just worried about this switch is going to ,sort worried switch going,worried sort switch
171,1611,1:19:00,Tom,have a tolerance factor so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off ,tolerance factor going er guaranteeing switch,switch tolerance er
172,1612,1:19:00,Tom,when before you come away,come away,away come
189,1613,1:19:00,Tony,yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn't you? because what you ,might get switch side might,switch side get
190,1614,1:20:00,Tony,want to have happen is ,want happen,happen want
191,1616,1:20:00,Tony,you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for ,need able accommodate mechanism,accommodate mechanism able
192,1617,1:20:00,Tony,contact purposes,contact purpose,contact purpose
193,1619,1:20:00,Tony,because what you don't want to have happen is that they come off the print ,want happen come print,happen print come
194,1620,1:20:00,Tony,head to come off before      ,head come,head come
173,1621,1:20:00,Tom,yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that allows that has one ,must must mechanism allows ha one,ha mechanism allows
174,1622,1:20:00,Tom,switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,switch say everything need contact,switch contact say
1623,1623,1:20:00,AJ,but what's qui if you wanted to have a certain angle       if you if you  ,qui wanted certain angle,angle wanted qui
175,1624,1:20:00,Tom, sorry I can’t ,sorry cannot,cannot sorry
1625,1625,1:20:00,AJ, had the mechanism like that so the actual pen width is so this way right so ,mechanism actual pen width way right,pen actual mechanism
1626,1626,1:20:00,AJ,you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah?,write bit actually turn way,turn write bit
1628,1628,1:20:00,AJ,so that means if you write left han  right handed or if you drag right ,mean write left han right handed drag right,han left drag
1629,1629,1:20:00,AJ,handed along the paper that way to be at the right angle and switched on ,handed along paper way right angle switched,paper switched handed
1630,1630,1:21:00,AJ,you will only need to touch that side and it will always be if it's in the ,need touch side always,touch side always
1631,1631,1:21:00,AJ,right angle it will switch on because it will touch that side if it's on left ,right angle switch touch side left,switch touch angle
1632,1632,1:21:00,AJ,handed mode ie your       it would be the opposite side then you have to ,handed mode ie would opposite side,side mode handed
1633,1633,1:21:00,AJ,switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,switch side switch left handed,switch handed left
149,1634,1:21:00,Jamie,that's an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode ,idea probably feature left right handed mode,mode left feature
1635,1635,1:21:00,AJ,yeah    see what I mean,see mean,mean see
1637,1637,1:21:00,AJ,well you'll hold it in the opposite way won't you? it depends on how you ,well hold opposite way depends,opposite depends hold
1638,1638,1:21:00,AJ,shape th the product as well but I think you certainly have to bear it in ,shape th product well certainly bear,shape product bear
1639,1639,1:21:00,AJ,mind that there's you know       ,mind know,mind know
150,1640,1:21:00,Jamie, I think  I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here if ,imagine imagine wa plot point line,imagine point plot
151,1641,1:21:00,Jamie,you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down and you ,apply force could drag pushing,force drag apply
152,1642,1:21:00,Jamie,could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,could also push pushing drag left handed push right handed,handed push drag
153,1644,1:22:00,Jamie,followed by a force,followed force,force followed
154,1646,1:22:00,Jamie,remember there doesn’t have to be something happening did you say,remember doe something happening say,remember doe happening
176,1648,1:22:00,Tom,yeah the force isn't necessarily erm,force necessarily erm,erm force necessarily
1651,1651,1:22:00,AJ,but it’s about it's about the angle being right switching the if you if you ,angle right switching,angle switching right
1652,1652,1:22:00,AJ,make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on ,make sure angle angle right way switch,angle switch make
1653,1653,1:22:00,AJ,so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on when ,switch suppose still switch,switch suppose still
177,1655,1:22:00,Tom,yeah can i  can I explain something before ,explain something,explain something
178,1657,1:22:00,Tom,because I didn't explain it right before so if that's if you come to a tilt ,explain right come tilt,explain tilt come
179,1658,1:22:00,Tom,here right then the head can come out      you design it so the ,right head come design,design head come
180,1661,1:22:00,Tom,and its still in contact with the paper and everything's hunky dory but it ,still contact paper everything hunky dory,contact paper dory
181,1662,1:23:00,Tom,has come forward a distance,ha come forward distance,ha distance forward
182,1665,1:23:00,Tom,carry on if you carry on with this and this and this is where you know this ,carry carry know,carry know
183,1666,1:23:00,Tom,is where it can't errm accommodate that wrong angle,cannot errm accommodate wrong angle,errm wrong accommodate
184,1668,1:23:00,Tom,then then its switched off anyway,switched anyway,switched anyway
185,1671,1:23:00,Tom,just a straight just a straight switch here based based on this based on this ,straight straight switch based based based,based straight switch
186,1672,1:23:00,Tom,distance there's a switch here,distance switch,distance switch
187,1674,1:23:00,Tom,there's a switch there and then its got a certain travel you know a certain ,switch got certain travel know certain,switch travel certain
188,1675,1:23:00,Tom,tolerance it works it's it's either on or off between here or here,tolerance work either,tolerance work either
195,1676,1:23:00,Tony,there’s another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea ,another could various way imagine sort disc idea,disc sort idea
196,1677,1:23:00,Tony,which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,could anything actually anything fastened rotating,fastened rotating actually
197,1679,1:23:00,Tony,you just put a window in there somewhere and poke a       through it in ,put window somewhere poke,poke put window
198,1683,1:24:00,Tony,so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,one edge defines far right one edge far left,edge left defines
189,1688,1:24:00,Tom, so there’s two ideas ,two idea,idea two
190,1692,1:24:00,Tom,that's that's quite good there’s either a mechanical,quite good either mechanical,good mechanical either
155,1698,1:24:00,Jamie,so there’s a minimum travel ,minimum travel,minimum travel
1702,1702,1:24:00,AJ,could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit so ,could switch outer sleeve centre bit,sleeve switch bit
1703,1703,1:24:00,AJ,if its gone beyond this outer sleeve     then it switches off where as if its ,gone beyond outer sleeve switch,sleeve outer switch
1704,1704,1:24:00,AJ,   where as its if its too far in its switched off as well so the edges here ,far switched well edge,edge switched far
1705,1705,1:25:00,AJ,when they're when they're roughly at the same angle so when these two ,roughly angle two,angle roughly two
1706,1706,1:25:00,AJ,are in contact so they're either level or slightly behind it then they can be ,contact either level slightly behind,level slightly contact
1707,1707,1:25:00,AJ,on but if its too far out it wont be on because its not touching these ,far wont touching,touching wont far
1708,1708,1:25:00,AJ,erm outer sleeves and if its too far in it also wont be working ,erm outer sleeve far also wont working,sleeve outer wont
1710,1710,1:25:00,AJ,because they don't touch this outer angle here,touch outer angle,angle outer touch
199,1711,1:25:00,Tony,yeah I think there's going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,going load way low cost switch,switch load cost
200,1714,1:25:00,Tony,and there aren't going to be er,going er,er going
201,1716,1:25:00,Tony,depend upon final weight of the final mechanism ,depend upon final weight final mechanism,final mechanism depend
191,1717,1:25:00,Tom,yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,point get away switch,switch point away
1718,1718,1:25:00,AJ,but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can ,also way floating head,floating head also
156,1720,1:25:00,Jamie,you could stick rather than springs and things you could just stick it on a ,could stick rather spring thing could stick,stick spring thing
157,1721,1:25:00,Jamie,on a rubbery pack or a film,rubbery pack film,film pack rubbery
77,1725,1:26:00,Charles,they start doing this sheath that hits first so th  if you fix that sheath onto ,start sheath hit first th fix sheath onto,sheath fix start
78,1726,1:26:00,Charles,a plunger that's sprung in a syringe when you push that in you have to ,plunger sprung syringe push,plunger push sprung
79,1727,1:26:00,Charles,push the air like that through a very small hole ,push air small hole,air hole push
80,1729,1:26:00,Charles,so you can’t do it quickly so you can't shock that thing that'll slo slow ,cannot quickly cannot shock thing slo slow,slow shock thing
81,1730,1:26:00,Charles,down and then it will slowly move back,slowly move back,back move slowly
82,1732,1:26:00,Charles,yeah but then when you take it off the paper it quickly pings back ,take paper quickly ping back,quickly ping back
83,1733,1:26:00,Charles,because this is a one way valve just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,one way valve bit rubber flap rubber,rubber valve flap
84,1735,1:26:00,Charles,they'll be air in there so that spring quickly returns it back down to it’s ,air spring quickly return back,return quickly air
85,1736,1:26:00,Charles,protective position,protective position,position protective
86,1738,1:26:00,Charles,so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly but as soon as you ,bang protected force come slowly soon,slowly force bang
87,1739,1:26:00,Charles,take it off it pings back,take ping back,back ping take
202,1742,1:27:00,Tony,so its just good point actually   I was just thinking that ,good point actually wa thinking,thinking point wa
203,1743,1:27:00,Tony,relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy so if we ,relatively carrier print head quite heavy,print heavy carrier
204,1744,1:27:00,Tony, contact with the surface its going to have quite a bit ,contact surface going quite bit,surface bit contact
205,1745,1:27:00,Tony,of momentum still so erm,momentum still erm,erm momentum still
88,1746,1:27:00,Charles,oh I see what you mean so  ,see mean,mean see
206,1747,1:27:00,Tony,quite hard or something that its pressed onto ,quite hard something pressed onto,pressed hard quite
89,1748,1:27:00,Charles,yeah it needs to it needs to be protected so it can't travel further forward it ,need need protected cannot travel forward,protected travel forward
90,1749,1:27:00,Charles,can only go backwards,go backwards,backwards go
207,1750,1:27:00,Tony,yeah we don't want it to come off anything or it could hinge forward ,want come anything could hinge forward,forward hinge could
208,1751,1:27:00,Tony,under its own momentum and then sort of smash onto something,momentum sort smash onto something,smash momentum sort
209,1753,1:27:00,Tony,the only other thing here it’s a spring imagine that's imagine that touches the ,thing spring imagine imagine touch,imagine spring thing
210,1754,1:27:00,Tony,paper  protected the bottom ,paper protected bottom,bottom paper protected
211,1755,1:27:00,Tony,there's two forces there isn't there there's sort of the ,two force sort,force sort two
212,1756,1:28:00,Tony,momentum of the thing itself,momentum thing,momentum thing
213,1758,1:28:00,Tony,yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,going anything heavy,heavy anything going
158,1759,1:28:00,Jamie,no well as I say you need to shock that down      ,well say need shock,shock need say
159,1762,1:28:00,Jamie,you're smash you're gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath ,smash gonna smash edge protective sheath,smash sheath edge
160,1763,1:28:00,Jamie,before this does anything in here,doe anything,doe anything
214,1764,1:28:00,Tony,yeah also they're not that      made out of ceramic and glass,also made ceramic glass,made ceramic glass
161,1765,1:28:00,Jamie,  I think that's I think that the other other protective thing is whether ,protective thing whether,protective thing whether
162,1766,1:28:00,Jamie,they smash it off the table before momentum,smash table momentum,momentum smash table
192,1768,1:28:00,Tom,It’s not it’s not really kids sort of throwing it down its also people ,really kid sort throwing also people,sort people throwing
215,1770,1:28:00,Tony,yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard ,bang concrete really hard,bang concrete hard
163,1771,1:28:00,Jamie,yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded then  you can smash the ,wa saying wa spring loaded smash,wa spring loaded
164,1772,1:29:00,Jamie,edge of this cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it ,edge co soon force get inside,inside force edge
1775,1775,1:29:00,AJ,what was the thing that you just wanted to sort of raise Tony about other ,wa thing wanted sort raise tony,wa thing raise
1776,1776,1:29:00,AJ,things you wanted to think about,thing wanted,thing wanted
216,1777,1:29:00,Tony,yes other ways besides      ,way besides,besides way
217,1779,1:29:00,Tony,or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the ,whatever could perhaps achieve holding thing flat,thing holding achieve
218,1780,1:29:00,Tony,surface the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,surface foam pad idea actually could imagine,imagine idea pad
219,1782,1:29:00,Tony,a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it and the print head ,foam pad aluminium carrier front print head,head front pad
220,1783,1:29:00,Tony,fastened to that and it can just squidge around ,fastened squidge around,fastened squidge around
221,1785,1:29:00,Tony,so yeah that would work it would also give you some a really cheap way ,would work would also give really cheap way,cheap work give
222,1786,1:29:00,Tony,of achieving a reasonable force a great density foam that could give you ,achieving reasonable force great density foam could give,give foam great
223,1787,1:29:00,Tony,the force of the print head ,force print head,force head print
224,1789,1:29:00,Tony,it could just recoil far enough it's a good idea actually,could recoil far enough good idea actually,good recoil idea
225,1791,1:29:00,Tony,that could work,could work,work could
1792,1792,1:29:00,AJ,you gonna hand out some bits of paper it’s alright isn't it?,gonna hand bit paper alright,hand gonna alright
165,1793,1:30:00,Jamie,a big sponge aluminium print head on the bottom all ,big sponge aluminium print head bottom,print bottom aluminium
166,1797,1:30:00,Jamie,I reck I reckon you move it around,reck reckon move around,reckon move reck
226,1798,1:30:00,Tony,yeah well you put this       ,well put,put well
227,1800,1:30:00,Tony,and it will just you've got spring and you've got some lovely,got spring got lovely,lovely spring got
1801,1801,1:30:00,AJ,could you even take that one further like you could build the foam around ,could even take one could build foam around,build foam one
1802,1802,1:30:00,AJ,the print head so you'd have to press the foam back to actually reveal the ,print head press foam back actually reveal,press head print
1803,1803,1:30:00,AJ,print head in the first place so it almost wraps round a little bit so if you ,print head first place almost wrap round little bit,bit round print
1804,1804,1:30:00,AJ,go like that the foam needs to,go foam need,foam go need
167,1805,1:30:00,Jamie, perhaps not wrapped around to the   extend in front of the housing,perhaps wrapped around extend front housing,housing front wrapped
1808,1808,1:30:00,AJ,so that you know you need to press the foam  ,know need press foam,foam press know
1810,1810,1:30:00,AJ,bit in before you actually start touching it,bit actually start touching,touching bit start
193,1811,1:30:00,Tom,yeah you need the foam to do some damping ,need foam damping,damping foam need
91,1812,1:30:00,Charles,so that's got to go somewhere,got go somewhere,go got somewhere
194,1813,1:31:00,Tom,yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of ,need foam tha sort sort,sort foam tha
195,1815,1:31:00,Tom,where where it doesn't want to move fast,doe want move fast,doe fast move
228,1817,1:31:00,Tony,well has to be down,well ha,ha well

172,1841,1:32:00,Jamie,air pockets are much cheaper,air pocket much cheaper,air cheaper pocket
1843,1843,1:32:00,AJ,it's still worth writing down,still worth writing,worth writing still
198,1844,1:32:00,Tom,well that doesn't have to be that could be a balloon inside ,well doe could balloon inside,inside doe balloon
94,1845,1:32:00,Charles,yeah you could put a it on a pneumatic bladder in,could put pneumatic bladder,bladder put pneumatic
231,1848,1:32:00,Tony,like a sort of bridge,sort bridge,bridge sort
95,1851,1:32:00,Charles,or you could do what they do in an old fashioned mouse not optical mouse ,could old fashioned mouse optical mouse,mouse optical fashioned
96,1852,1:32:00,Charles,with the b ball just use gravity because it’s own weight makes it roll on the ,ball use gravity weight make roll,roll make ball

232,1854,1:32:00,Tony,yeah stuck by gravity ,stuck gravity,gravity stuck
233,1856,1:32:00,Tony,that would work,would work,work would
199,1857,1:32:00,Tom,five hundred grams is that wh is that the      ?,five hundred gram wh,wh gram hundred
98,1858,1:33:00,Charles,oh you need five hundred grams OK that's fi ,need five hundred gram ok fi,hundred gram fi
200,1859,1:33:00,Tom,you need five hundred grams?,need five hundred gram,gram hundred five
173,1863,1:33:00,Jamie,how far’s five hundred grams?,far five hundred gram,hundred gram far
46,1864,1:33:00,Robert,er       er yeah if you take it to twenty mill sort of half the compression that ,er er take twenty mill sort half compression,er mill sort
174,1866,1:33:00,Jamie,I didn't realise what this was this is a prototype      ,realise wa prototype,prototype realise wa
201,1867,1:33:00,Tom,it's a prototype model,prototype model,model prototype
234,1868,1:33:00,Tony,it's not really a prototype,really prototype,prototype really
1869,1869,1:33:00,AJ,well its       test,well test,test well
1872,1872,1:33:00,AJ,why do you need that force?,need force,force need
202,1873,1:33:00,Tom,err expensive,err expensive,err expensive
175,1875,1:33:00,Jamie,well if you well if you well if you've got heat here and here its zero ,well well well got heat zero,heat got well
1877,1877,1:33:00,AJ,yeah so you need quite a strong contact basically,need quite strong contact basically,strong basically contact
203,1878,1:33:00,Tom,well if you've got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five?,well got go ten mil instead five,mil ten instead
176,1879,1:33:00,Jamie,well then you're going to have a  ,well going,going well
177,1881,1:33:00,Jamie,that's what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we ,one question wa switch go past,switch past wa
178,1882,1:33:00,Jamie,want to wa  ,want wa,wa want
179,1884,1:33:00,Jamie,one you're inside the protective thing two it's not got power,one inside protective thing two got power,power protective thing
204,1888,1:34:00,Tom,this is really difficult isn't it,really difficult,difficult really
180,1893,1:34:00,Jamie,it’s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,skilled personnel use lab,lab personnel skilled
181,1895,1:34:00,Jamie,well we don't that      that tests how,well test,test well
182,1897,1:34:00,Jamie,the print quality in a way,print quality way,print quality way
183,1900,1:34:00,Jamie,what is the range of angles ,range angle,angle range
235,1901,1:34:00,Tony,it's just to measure what you what the parameters are if you like,measure parameter,measure parameter
236,1902,1:34:00,Tony,it's just its just to give us some guidance,give u guidance,give guidance
205,1908,1:34:00,Tom, so what we're talking about is  is where rather than having that as the ,talking rather,talking rather
206,1909,1:34:00,Tom,range of movement we're talking about having a thing like a spring which ,range movement talking thing spring,talking spring movement
237,1912,1:35:00,Tony,      talking about is probably er ,talking probably er,er talking probably
184,1917,1:35:00,Jamie,yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit it’s ,talking actually moving bit,talking bit moving
185,1918,1:35:00,Jamie,actually much easier because this bit you've got the moving bit,actually much easier bit got moving bit,bit moving easier
186,1920,1:35:00,Jamie,that affects position what we're really talking about is that the print head ,affect position really talking print head,print position affect
187,1923,1:35:00,Jamie, that is easier to use  ,easier use,easier use
207,1924,1:35:00,Tom, yeah to make this to make this the same you'd have to you'd have to ,make make,make
208,1925,1:35:00,Tom,extend a cylinder over this thing,extend cylinder thing,cylinder extend thing
209,1927,1:35:00,Tom,and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,cylinder would come,cylinder come would
238,1928,1:35:00,Tony,yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that where it ,going much compact version,compact version going
239,1929,1:35:00,Tony,will only move maybe a couple of millimetres and then it would be an ,move maybe couple millimetre would,move millimetre couple
240,1930,1:35:00,Tony,outer casement,outer casement,casement outer
241,1932,1:35:00,Tony,so you could continue to drag the      along,could continue drag along,continue drag along
242,1935,1:35:00,Tony,        still get a sense of the force,still get sense force,force sense get
99,1937,1:35:00,Charles,actually five hundred grams that means this sort of thing isn't going to work ,actually five hundred gram mean sort thing going work,sort hundred thing
100,1938,1:36:00,Charles,oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that ,mean ha got five hundred gram push,hundred ha push
101,1939,1:36:00,Charles,back if you had a sheath you have to press that has to be more than fi   ou ,back sheath press ha fi ou,press ha back
102,1940,1:36:00,Charles,have to make it come back and provide an extra five hundred grams,make come back provide extra five hundred gram,hundred provide make
243,1941,1:36:00,Tony,it depends what the sheath's doing,depends sheath,depends sheath
103,1942,1:36:00,Charles,if the sheath's if the sheath's a sprung sheath then you've got to ,sheath sheath sprung sheath got,sheath sprung got
104,1945,1:36:00,Charles,another five hundred grams,another five hundred gram,hundred gram another
244,1946,1:36:00,Tony,erm but most the value in the sheath might be to protect against kind of ,erm value sheath might protect kind,erm sheath kind
245,1947,1:36:00,Tony,catching sideways edges and things,catching sideways edge thing,catching edge sideways
105,1948,1:36:00,Charles,erm you're right,erm right,erm right
210,1949,1:36:00,Tom,it doesn't work this sheath does it?,doe work sheath doe,doe sheath work
106,1950,1:36:00,Charles,well it does work but it just means you got to press harder doesn't it,well doe work mean got press harder doe,doe press work
246,1951,1:36:00,Tony,well only if its  yeah but      does it,well doe,doe well
211,1954,1:36:00,Tom,        provides the spacing,provides spacing,spacing provides
212,1956,1:36:00,Tom,yeah it doesn't have to be heavy,doe heavy,doe heavy
107,1957,1:36:00,Charles,five hundred grams isn't very much,five hundred gram much,gram hundred five
1958,1958,1:36:00,AJ,do you want to explore any other angles any other,want explore angle,angle explore want
247,1962,1:37:00,Tony,is there five hundred grams?,five hundred gram,gram hundred five
188,1963,1:37:00,Jamie,well is there anything else?,well anything else,anything else well
248,1964,1:37:00,Tony,quite a lot it is a lot is a lot for a pen,quite lot lot lot pen,lot pen quite
